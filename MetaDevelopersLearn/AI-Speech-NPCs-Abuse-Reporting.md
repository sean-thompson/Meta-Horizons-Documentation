# AI Speech NPCs Abuse Reporting

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/ai-speech-npcs/ai-speech-abuse-reporting)

Players have the ability to submit abuse reports for specific worlds and NPCs within the world. This is a way for players to flag potential [Horizon Worlds Content Guidelines](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/restrictions-to-worlds-in-horizon) violations. When this happens, the world and NPCs will be reviewed to determine whether a violation exists. If a violation is found, the world will be evaluated for appropriate age ratings and violations.

If the worldâ€™s maturity rating needs to be raised (e.g. 13+, 18+), we will send an email to the world owner that their **maturity rating has been adjusted**, restricting access to users within the appropriate age range. If there is a content violation, we will send an email to the world owner that the **world has been unpublished**. The world owner can fix the violation and attempt to publish the world again 24 hours later. The updated world will only be published if a subsequent review determines that it no longer violates the content policy. If there is a severe violation, the world owner will receive an email that their **world is deleted**.
