[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/sfx/adding-sound-in-horizon)

There are a variety of sounds available to use in Build Mode. You can add them to your world from the Build section of the Creator Menu including:

*   Sound effects

*   Background

*   Music

## To add a sound to your world:

*   From your **Creator Menu**, select **Sounds**.

*   Find a sound you want, then grab the sound and pull it into your world.

Each sound is a considered to be one object, and all sounds have a properties panel with a **Sound** tab to preview the sound and make adjustments.

Sound properties include:

*   **Preview Audio**: Tap Play to hear the sound.

*   **Pitch**: Use this to adjust the playback speed.

*   **Minimum Distance**: The distance (in meters) at which a sound will be heard at maximum volume.

*   **Maximum Distance**: The distance (in meters) at which a sound will no longer be heard.

*   **Global**: Turn this on to make the sound heard globally at the same volume regardless of a player’s position in the world. Turning Global off means the sound will be perceived as coming from the sound’s location in the world.

*   **Play on Start**: Turn this on to have the sound start playing as soon as a player enters the world.

*   **Volume**: This will adjust the sound’s volume.

*   **Name**: The name of the sound. **Note**: Some properties aren’t available for certain sounds.
