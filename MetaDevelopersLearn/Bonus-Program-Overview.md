# Bonus Program Overview

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/bonus-program-overview)

We offer a variety of creator bonuses as a way of rewarding Meta Horizon Creator Program members contributing their talent and hard work to the Meta Horizon Worlds ecosystem.

There are currently three types of bonuses creators can earn: Time Spent on Mobile bonus, Time Spent on Headset bonus, and In-World Purchases bonus.

Each world has a monthly max limit of $250,000 across the bonus types, however creators have no limit on earnings at an individual level.

To track the progress of your bonus, go to the [Creator Portal](https://horizon.meta.com/creator/) and navigate to **Creator Program** \> **Bonuses**. For more information, please review the [Bonus Program Analytics](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/monetization/) article. **Note:** Creator bonuses are not subject to hardware platform fees and will be paid to creators in full. Meta Horizon Worlds Creator bonuses will be offered for a limited time. Over time, bonuses and goals may evolve, for example, to encourage creators to adopt new tools or features. Bonuses for headset and mobile goals are tracked and awarded separately.

## Time Spent on Headset bonus

This bonus rewards creators for building worlds that attract the most time spent in headsets.

*   **Eligibility**: Creator’s worlds that reach at least 150 hours of eligible time spent in headsets during the bonus period. Eligible time spent is determined by making adjustments to total time spent in a world to remove time spent by creators, collaborators, and playtesters, and to account for any form of suspicious engagement, including unregistered bots or networks of policy-violating user accounts.
    

*   **How the bonus is calculated**: A creator’s share of the monthly bonus pool is based on the percentage of time spent in their eligible worlds out of the total eligible time spent in headsets across all Creator Program worlds during the bonus period.
    

*   **How to increase bonus earnings**: The best way for a creator to increase the amount they can earn each bonus period is by increasing the eligible time spent in their worlds by people in headsets. This is because it increases the chance for having a higher contribution to overall time spent in Creator Program worlds during the bonus period.
    

## Time Spent on Mobile bonus

This bonus rewards creators for building worlds that attract the most time spent on mobile devices.

*   **Eligibility:**
    
     Creator’s worlds that reach at least 50 hours of eligible time spent on mobile devices for the bonus period. Eligible time spent is determined by making adjustments to total time spent in a world to remove time spent by creators, collaborators, and playtesters, and to account for any form of suspicious engagement, including unregistered bots or networks of policy-violating user accounts.
    

*   **How the bonus is calculated:**
    
     A creator’s share of the monthly bonus pool is based on the percentage of time spent in their eligible worlds out of the total eligible time spent on mobile devices across all Creator Program worlds.
    

*   **How to increase bonus earnings**: The best way for a creator to increase the amount they can earn each bonus period is by increasing the eligible time spent in their worlds by people on mobile devices. This is because it increases the chance for having a higher contribution to overall time spent in Creator Program worlds during the bonus period.
    

## In-World Purchase bonus

This bonus rewards creators for selling in-world purchases.

*   **Eligibility**: Creator’s worlds that reach at least 600 monthly unique visitors are eligible for the in-world purchase bonus.
    

*   **How the bonus is calculated**: A creator’s monthly bonus is based on both the average number of Meta Credits exchanged per monthly visitor to your eligible worlds, and your earnings from in-world purchases during the bonus period. The average Meta Credits exchanged, which is the total number of Meta Credits exchanged divided by the eligible number of unique visitors to a world during the bonus period, determines the bonus multiplier applied to your in-world purchase earning as follows:
    

*   Less than 1 average Meta Credit exchanged = 70% multiplier off earnings

*   1-5 average Meta Credits exchanged = 80% multiplier of earnings

*   5-10 average Meta Credits exchanged = 90% multiplier of earnings

*   10-15 average Meta Credits exchanged =100% multiplier of earnings

*   More than 15 average Meta Credits exchanged = 110% multiplier of earnings
    

*   **How to increase bonus earnings**: There are a few ways to increase how much you can earn from this bonus. The first is to increase the average number of Meta Credits exchanged during the bonus period by growing the number of visitors making in-world purchases and the amount of Meta Credits they use. This is because the higher the average of Meta Credits exchanged per user, the higher your bonus multiplier will be. You can also increase your bonus by growing your overall monthly earnings, because the multiplier for the bonus is applied to your total monthly earnings from in-world purchases during the bonus period.

## Mobile milestone rewards

These are one-time rewards that can be earned as creators grow their mobile worlds, with more active monthly users spending more time in said worlds. As these are one-time rewards, they will only be activated once, regardless of how many worlds hit the rewards thresholds.

*   **Eligibility**: You are automatically enrolled for milestone rewards when accepted into the Meta Horizon Creators Program. To be eligible, creators need to have had fewer than 200 mobile visitors to any of their worlds and less than 350 hours of mobile time spent.
    

*   **How the bonus is calculated**: Milestone rewards are calculated by measuring the mobile visitors and eligible mobile time spent in your worlds in the last 28 days. Your first world to reach a milestone within a 28-day period will unlock the associated reward. Please see your current milestone status within creator tools. The current milestones and rewards are as follows:
    

*   10 mobile monthly active users and 6 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $25 reward

*   30 mobile monthly active users and 15 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $100 reward

*   50 mobile monthly active users and 30 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $500 reward

*   100 mobile monthly active users and 50 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $1,000 reward

*   200 mobile monthly active users and 100 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $1,000 reward

*   200 mobile monthly active users and 200 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $1,000 reward

*   200 mobile monthly active users and 350 hrs monthly mobile time spent = $1,000 reward
    

*   **How to reach new milestones**: The best way for a creator to reach the next milestone is by increasing the number of visitors and eligible time spent in their worlds by people on mobile devices.

## Bonus enrollment

Be sure to mark your calendars, as each bonus requires monthly enrollment, and sign up begins 7 days before the 1st of each month. For example, a creator wanting to sign up for March 2025 bonuses can sign up as early as February 22, when enrollment opens. Mobile milestones rewards do not require monthly sign-ups, and you are automatically enrolled as a member of the Meta Horizon Creator Program.

Enrollment is available via the **Monetization Bonus** tab of the [Creator Portal](https://horizon.meta.com/creator/worlds_all/) , and enrolled members are eligible to earn for the first 28 days of the month, regardless of when in the month they sign up.

Sign ups typically close about 7 days before the end of the month, as sign ups for the next month open. All monthly bonus earnings will be paid to your payout account within 60 days following the end of each bonus period.

Creators participating in any monetization programs, including in-world purchases and creator bonuses, are required to follow all Meta Horizon Worlds policies in order to be eligible for earnings, including the [Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences Policy](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/) and [Meta Horizon Worlds Content Guidelines](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/restrictions-to-worlds-in-horizon) .
