# CodeBlock Events

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/events/codeblock-events)

CodeBlock events enable your TypeScript code to send and receive events from CodeBlock or TypeScript scripts. These events communicate asynchronously with all players in the world by default. This ensures the server manages world behavior consistently for all users.

CodeBlock events restrict you to calling CodeBlock-specific functions, such as communicating between components with objects owned by different players or listening for events sent to specific players. This means that CodeBlock events can only process the basic data types available in CodeBlock scripts, such as numbers, strings, and entities. [API docs for CodeBlock events](https://horizon.meta.com/resources/scripting-api/core.codeblockevent.md/?api_version=2.0.0) .

## Creating a custom CodeBlock event

To create a custom CodeBlock event:

*   Specify the parameter names and types that are sent by the event.

*   Specify an event name.

*   List the `PropTypes` for each parameter that is sent by the event.

Your CodeBlock event should look like the following:

```
sendEvent = new CodeBlockEvent<[player_name: string, player_id: number]>('testSendEvent', [PropTypes.String, PropTypes.Number]);
```

## Sending CodeBlock events

To send a CodeBlock event, use the [Component.sendCodeBlockEvent](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_component#sendcodeblockevent) method.

## Subscribing to CodeBlock events

To receive events from CodeBlock scripts, use the [Component.connectCodeBlockEvent](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_component#connectcodeblockevent) method.

## Example - Sending to CodeBlocks

```
import { Component, CodeBlockEvent, Entity, PropTypes } from 'horizon/core';

class CodeBlockEvent_CB extends Component<typeof CodeBlockEvent_CB> {

  static propsDefinition= {
    target: {type: PropTypes.Entity},
  };

  sendEvent = new CodeBlockEvent<[player_name: String, player_id: Number]>('sendEvent', [PropTypes.String, PropTypes.Number]);
  receiveEvent = new CodeBlockEvent<[score: Number]>('receiveEvent', [PropTypes.Number]);

  start() {
    // Register for CodeBlock events.
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
    this.entity,
    this.receiveEvent,
    (score: Number) => {
       console.log(score);
     });

    // Delay by 500 milliseconds to ensure listeners are ready.
    this.async.setTimeout(() => {
      this.sendCodeBlockEvent(
        this.props.target!,
        this.sendEvent,
        "Player One",
        123
      );
     }, 500);
    }
  }
Component.register(CodeBlockEvent_CB);
```

## Example - Sending to TypeScript

```
import { Component, CodeBlockEvent, Entity, PropTypes } from 'horizon/core';

class CodeBlockEvent_TS extends Component{
  sendEvent = new CodeBlockEvent<[player_name: String, player_id: Number]>('sendEvent', [PropTypes.String, PropTypes.Number]);

  start () {
    // Register to receive CodeBlock event.
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
      this.entity,
      this.sendEvent,
      (player_name: String, score: Number) => {
        console.log(player_name + ": " + score);
      });

    // Delay by 500 milliseconds to ensure listeners are ready.
    this.async.setTimeout(() => {
      this.sendCodeBlockEvent(
        this.entity,
        this.sendEvent,
        "Player One",
        123
      );
    }, 500);
  }
}

Component.register(CodeBlockEvent_TS);
```

## Example - Sending an event to a Player

```
import * as hz from 'horizon/core';

class CodeBlockEvent_Player extends hz.Component {
  sendEvent = new hz.CodeBlockEvent<[msg: string]>('sendEvent', [hz.PropTypes.String]);

  playerList: hz.Player[] = [];

  start() {
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
      this.entity,
      hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterWorld,
      (player: hz.Player) => {
        this.playerList.push(player);
        this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
          player,
          this.sendEvent,
          (msg: string) => {
            console.log(msg);
          });
      }
 );

    this.async.setInterval(() => {
      this.playerList.forEach(player => {
        this.sendCodeBlockEvent(
          player,
          this.sendEvent,
          "Hello " + player.name.get() + "!"
        );
      });
    }, 5000);
  }
}
```

## Built-in CodeBlock events

There are a number of built-in CodeBlock events for common cases, such as when a player enters or exits the world, or when an object is grabbed by a player. The TypeScript API provides access to the built-in CodeBlock events through the `CodeBlockEvents` variable.

The following table lists some of the most common built-in CodeBlock events you can subscribe to. For a complete list, see the the [API docs for the CodeBlockEvents variable](https://horizon.meta.com/resources/scripting-api/core.codeblockevents.md/?api_version=2.0.0) .

      }
    );
      this.connectCodeBlockEvent (
