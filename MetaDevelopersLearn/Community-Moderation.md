# Community Moderation **Note:** This feature is slowly rolling out and may not be available to all users yet. **Moderating your community** Users interact in your world in real time. This can raise concerns over how to best moderate and maintain your world’s culture and safety. Community moderators can help alleviate these concerns.

Community moderators provide a way to leverage existing community members to set and enforce norms within specific worlds. They have the ability to intervene in situations, helping to ensure your world remains a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Moderators have the following abilities:

*   **Mute or Unmute:**
    
     If someone’s causing trouble, they can mute them for 15 minutes. Moderators can also unmute users when things cool down.

*   **Warn**: If someone’s causing trouble, they can send a private warning message to a user to inform them that they are not following world norms.

*   **Remove:**
    
     In more serious cases, moderators can remove people from the world to keep the peace. **Invite members to be community moderators** You can invite eligible members of your community to be moderators from the **Manage People** menu.

*   Open the **Manage People** menu through the World Detail Page.

*   Click on the **Invite People** button in the upper right corner.

*   Select the **Moderator** role and customize the name that will appear on their nametag from the dropdown menu.

*   By default, moderators can send warnings, mute people for everyone in the world, and remove people from the world. Select the toggles next to each ability to turn these abilities on or off for the moderator.

*   Click **Invite** to send your invitation.

*   You will receive a notification if the person accepts your invite.

*   Once the invite is accepted, the member will appear under the **Collaborators** tab on the **Manage People** menu. Members with a moderator role are indicated by a shield icon. **Cancel an invite to be a community moderator** *   Open the **Manage People** menu through the World Detail Page.

*   Select **Invites** to see pending collaborator invites.

*   Select a member and click **Cancel invite**.

**Revoke a member’s moderator role**

*   Open the **Manage People** menu through the World Detail Page.

*   Select the **Collaborators** tab to see all active collaborators.

*   Select a member and click **Revoke access** to remove the member’s moderator capabilities.
