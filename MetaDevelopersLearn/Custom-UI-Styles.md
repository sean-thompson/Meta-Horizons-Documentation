# Custom UI Styles

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/custom-ui/api-reference-for-custom-ui)

The available styles for [customizing](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/custom-ui/creating-a-custom-ui-panel) UI panels in your world are defined in the type aliases of the [UI](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/ui_uicomponent) API, such as the [ColorValue](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/ui_colorvalue) type. This topic describes the available style for each type.

Type aliases:

## LayoutStyle

API documentation: [LayoutStyle](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/ui_layoutstyle) type alias.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| display | Bindable<'none' \\| 'flex'> | [Default: 'flex']Similar to display in CSS, but only supports ‘none’ and ‘flex’. The display mode of the UI element.none: The UI element is not rendered.flex: The UI element is displayed as a block. This is the default value. |
| height | Bindable<number \\| string> | Similar to height in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| width | Bindable<number \\| string> | Similar to width in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| bottom | number \\| string | Similar to bottom in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| end | number \\| string | Equivalent to right when direction is 'ltr'. Equivalent to left when direction is 'rtl'. |
| left | number \\| string | Similar to left in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| right | number \\| string | Similar to right in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| start | number \\| string | Equivalent to left when direction is 'ltr'. Equivalent to right when direction is 'rtl'. |
| top | number \\| string | Similar to top in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| minWidth | number \\| string | Similar to min-width in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| maxWidth | number \\| string | Similar to max-width in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| minHeight | number \\| string | Similar to min-height in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| maxHeight | number \\| string | Similar to max-height in CSS, but only supports points and percentages. Ems and other units are not supported. |
| margin | number \\| string | Setting margin has the same effect as setting each of marginTop, marginLeft, marginBottom, and marginRight. |
| marginBottom | number \\| string | Works like margin-bottom in CSS. |
| marginEnd | number \\| string | Equivalent to marginRight when direction is 'ltr'. Equivalent to marginLeft when direction is 'rtl'. |
| marginHorizontal | number \\| string | Setting marginHorizontal has the same effect as setting both marginLeft and marginRight. |
| marginLeft | number \\| string | Works like margin-left in CSS. |
| marginRight | number \\| string | Works like margin-right in CSS. |
| marginStart | number \\| string | Equivalent to marginLeft when direction is 'ltr'. Equivalent to marginRight when direction is 'rtl'. |
| marginTop | number \\| string | Works like margin-top in CSS. |
| marginVertical | number \\| string | Setting marginVertical has the same effect as setting both marginTop and marginBottom. |
| padding | number \\| string | Setting padding has the same effect as setting each of paddingTop, paddingBottom, paddingLeft, and paddingRight. |
| paddingBottom | number \\| string | Works like padding-bottom in CSS. |
| paddingEnd | number \\| string | Equivalent to paddingRight when direction is 'ltr'. Equivalent to paddingLeft when direction is 'rtl'. |
| paddingHorizontal | number \\| string | Setting paddingHorizontal has the same effect as setting both paddingLeft and paddingRight. |
| paddingLeft | number \\| string | Works like padding-left in CSS. |
| paddingRight | number \\| string | Works like padding-right in CSS. |
| paddingStart | number \\| string | Equivalent to paddingLeft when direction is 'ltr'. Equivalent to paddingRight when direction is 'rtl'. |
| paddingTop | number \\| string | Works like padding-top in CSS. |
| paddingVertical | number \\| string | Setting paddingVertical has the same effect as setting both paddingTop and paddingBottom. |
| position | 'absolute' \\| 'relative' | [Default: 'relative']Similar to position in CSS, but everything is set to 'relative' by default, so ‘absolute’ positioning is always relative to the parent. |
| flexDirection | 'row''row-reverse''column''column-reverse' | [Default: 'column'] Works like flex-direction in CSS, except the default is ‘column’. Controls the direction of the main axis, in which the children are stacked. |
| flexWrap | 'nowrap''wrap''wrap-reverse' | [Default: 'nowrap'] Works like flex-wrap in CSS. Controls whether children can wrap around after they hit the end of a flex container. |
| justifyContent | 'flex-start''flex-end''center''space-between''space-around''space-evenly' | [Default: ‘flex-start’] Works like justify-content in CSS. Aligns children in the main direction (along the main axis). For example, if children are flowing vertically, justifyContent controls how they align vertically. |
| alignContent | 'flex-start''flex-end''center''stretch''space-between''space-around' | [Default: 'flex-start'] Works like align-content in CSS. Aligns rows or columns in the cross direction (perpendicular to the main axis). Only works if flexWrap is enabled and there are multiple rows or columns. |
| alignItems | 'flex-start''flex-end''center''stretch''baseline' | [Default: 'stretch'] Works like align-items in CSS. Aligns children within a row or column in the cross direction (perpendicular to the main axis). For example, if children are flowing vertically, alignItems controls how they align horizontally. |
| alignSelf | 'auto''flex-start''flex-end''center''stretch''baseline' | [Default: 'auto'] Works like align-self in CSS. Controls how a child aligns in the cross direction (perpendicular to the main axis), overriding the alignItems of the parent. |
| overflow | 'visible' \\| 'hidden' | [Default: 'visible'] Works like overflow in CSS. Controls how children are measured and displayed. 'hidden' causes views to be clipped. |
| flex | number | flex does not work the same way as in CSS. flex is a number rather than a string. When flex is a positive number, the component is flexible and will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with flex set to ‘2’ will take twice the space as a component with flex set to ‘1’. flex: X (where X is a positive number) equates to flexGrow: X, flexShrink: 1, flexBasis: 0. When flex is ‘0’ , the component is inflexible and is sized according to width and height. When flex is ‘-1’, the component is normally sized according to width and height. However, if there’s not enough space, the component will shrink to its minWidth and minHeight. |
| flexGrow | number | [Default: ‘0’] Works like flex-grow in CSS. Accepts a float number >= 0. Describes how the remaining space in the container should be distributed among its children along the main axis. After laying out its children, a container will distribute any remaining space among its children weighted by the children’s flexGrow values. |
| flexShrink | number | [Default: ‘0’] Works like flex-shrink in CSS. Accepts a float number >= 0. Describes how to shrink children along the main axis when the total size of the children overflows the size of the container. A container will shrink its children weighted by the children’s flexShrink values. flexShrink is very similar to flexGrow and can be thought of in the same way if any overflowing size is considered to be negative remaining space. These two properties also work well together. |
| flexBasis | number \\| string | Works like flex-basis in CSS. Specifies the default size of an item along the main axis of the container, that is, the size of the item before any flexGrow and flexShrink calculations are performed. |
| aspectRatio | number | Controls the size of the undefined dimension of a component. It takes min/max dimensions into account. If one of width/height is set, aspect ratio controls the size of the unset dimension. If flex basis/grow/shrink is set, aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset. |
| zIndex | number | Works like z-index in CSS. Controls which components display on top of others – components with a larger zIndex will render on top. If zIndex are not specified, components render according to their order in the document tree – later components draw over earlier ones. zIndex can be used if you don’t want this default behavior. |
| layoutOrigin | [number, number] | [Default: '[0, 0]'] The origin of the UI element when position is 'absolute', where [0, 0] is the top left of the element and [1, 1] is the bottom right of the element. |
| direction | 'inherit''ltr''rtl' | [Default: 'inherit'] Specifies the directional flow of the user interface. |

Each object specifies the property that will be transformed as the key, and the value to use in the transformation.rotate: Rotate the element around the transformOrigin. Value requires a string expressed in degrees (e.g. ‘45deg’ ) or radians (e.g. ‘0.7854rad’).scale: Scale the element uniformly by the given multiplier, with the transformOrigin being the fixed point.
