With the creator portal heatmap functionality, you can view the amount of time users spend in your world, as well as the positions they exit from. Additionally, you can see any crash positions in the world. Information is overlaid on your world mesh for ease of understanding.

The heatmap consists of a viewport to examine the default 3d assets of a world with data plotted against the 3d assets, as well as filters to choose which metrics to display. The current heatmap metrics are:

*   Total user time spent in-world for the last day/week/month

*   Crashes in-world for the last day/week/month

*   Exits of users from the world in the last day/week/month

You have the capability to hide data by percentile, hide the world 3d assets, and click a data point to view its value.

Filters allow you to see counts for mobile, web, or VR users, as well as a total for all users regardless of device type.

Finally, you can switch between a high, medium, or low level of detail for your 3d heatmap.
