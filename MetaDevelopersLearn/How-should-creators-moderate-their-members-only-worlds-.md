# How should creators moderate their members-only worlds?

Creators, and their appointed moderators, have access to, and should use, the following tools to effectively moderate their members-only worlds:

*   **Mute for World**
    
     \- When you mute someone for the world, no one in the world can hear them. Choosing this option mutes a person for two hours and the muting can be turned off by the moderator at any point during this duration. For example, moderators may choose to use this tool if someone is being extremely loud in a world and potentially disrupting an intentionally calm environment.
    

*   **Remove**
    
     \- When you remove someone from the world you have the option to either remove them for 2 hours or permanently remove their access to the world. For public worlds, removal is only for 2 hours. A moderator may choose to remove a disruptive person from a world for 2 hours as a warning, letting them know that their behavior is unacceptable in the world. If a creator feels that a member has consistently disregarded the world rules or been disrespectful, a permanent removal could be warranted. **Note**: Only world owners can permanently remove members from a members-only world, moderators cannot remove members permanently.

*   **Mute, Block, Poll to Remove, Report**
    
     \- Creators can also use tools that are available to everyone such as [Mute, Block, Poll to remove, Report](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/horizon/safety-and-privacy-in-horizon-worlds/) . These actions apply on a 1 to 1 basis, for instance, muting an individual will only apply for your direct interactions with that person, while others around you will still be able to hear them. **Note**: While in members-only worlds, the world creator and moderators cannot be targeted by Poll to remove.

*   **Change Role**
    
     \- Creators can modify a collaborator’s role within their world through the Manage People panel. Moderators also have the ability to change their role within a members-only world. If a creator learns that an existing moderator no longer wishes to perform this role, they can update this and invite a new member to become a moderator.

To help ensure members-only worlds are properly moderated, creators can invite any member to become a moderator of the world. The creator can also choose to make the world available only when a moderator is present, ensuring that there is moderator coverage at all times.

Creators should set appropriate moderation expectations with selected moderators, reviewing and updating who holds this role, as needed. During the alpha, world creators will remain the responsible party for anything that occurs in their world, so it is important to assign moderator roles to members who are trusted and can confidently carry out their duties in creating a positive experience for world members.
