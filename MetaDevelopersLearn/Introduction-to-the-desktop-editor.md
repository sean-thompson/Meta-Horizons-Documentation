Important

Use of the Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor is limited to persons aged 13 and above. Meta reserves the right to conduct its own review of the information that a creator provides to determine whether the age group provided by the creator is accurate. Any misrepresentation of user's age group may result in rejection, suspension, or removal of that creator's account and/or world.

The desktop editor is one of the main tools youâ€™ll use to create in Meta Horizon Worlds. It enables you to create nearly all aspects of the worlds in which your players interact, as well as to create and modify the objects they interact with. The desktop editor is Windows-based, and you control it with just your keyboard and mouse, rather than having to use a VR headset. Building a world with the desktop editor is very similar to building an app using Unity, so this can make make your job as a creator much easier and more efficient.

Using the desktop editor when creating your world makes it easier to:

*   Create a new world

*   Make changes to it while the world is running

*   Easily update entity values

*   Write and easily debug TypeScript code
