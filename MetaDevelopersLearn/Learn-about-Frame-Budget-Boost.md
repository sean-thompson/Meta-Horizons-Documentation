Frame Budget Boost is an optional feature for Meta Quest creators that improves performance and frame rate of up to 72 frames per second. Frame Budget Boost will enable creators to build larger, more complex worlds with higher concurrent players while increasing frame rates. Frame Budget Boost settings can be managed in your creator settings.

## Frame Budget Boost requirements

Frame Budget Boost will not work if your world performance can’t meet very low FPS thresholds (<45 FPS) or if your world is hitching (missing multiple frames). Improve your world’s performance by reducing world complexity so you can meet the minimum performance requirements.

## Manage Frame Budget Boost settings

To manage Frame Budget Boost as a world creator:

*   Open the Creator UI.

*   Select the **World Settings** tab.

*   Select **Player Settings** in the left menu.

*   Find **Frame Budget Boost (Early Access)** and select the applicable dropdown.

During Early Access, the default setting for Frame Budget Boost will result in a small percentage of visitors to your world experiencing “Frame Budget Boost”. You can override the default setting to turn Frame Budget Boost on/off for all the visitors in your world.

## Frame Budget Boost visual artifacts

Visual artifacts are minor visual distortions that occur during faster motions near thin lines on edges and certain surfaces such as railings, window frames or door thresholds. You may notice minor bending or graphical changes near certain thin lines when Frame Budget Boost is enabled. Visual artifacts may be present and will vary from world to world. Turn Frame Budget Boost off in your world if you find the visual artifacts to be distracting.

Frame Budget Boost is implemented by adaptively enabling Application SpaceWarp.
