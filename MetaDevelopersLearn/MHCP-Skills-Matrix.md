## Design

Focuses on experience design, encompassing user interaction, engagement mechanics, and the overall user journey. These skills align with industry roles in design.

### Mechanics

The main interactions, rules, procedures that a player uses/interacts with (that are fun/delightful/useful) via items, interactions, UI, etc.

| Main Competency | Description | Focus Here If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Education | Designs mechanics that are intuitively understood, incorporating tutorials and progressive learning. | New players find it hard to grasp basic gameplay or to access features. |
| Variation | Introduces mechanics with diverse outcomes and interactions to sustain interest and avoid monotony. | Gameplay feels too predictable or repetitive after initial engagement. |
| Relevance | Ensures mechanics directly contribute to and impact the game’s narrative and goals. | Players feel disconnected or find the gameplay actions lacking significance. |
| Balance | Ensures fair play by providing multiple strategic options and equalizing opportunities for success. | Player feedback indicates a lack of variety or fairness in gameplay. |
| Innovation | Innovates by creating or significantly improving mechanics to offer new challenges and experiences. | Players feel the gameplay lacks novelty or fails to differentiate from others. |

### Core Loop

The creation of meaning/accomplishment/feedback when repeatedly using the (main) mechanics.

| Main Competency | Description | Focus Here If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility | Ensures the core loop is intuitive and engaging from the start, with clear instructions and entry points. | New players are overwhelmed or confused at the beginning of an experience. |
| Goals & Rewards | Crafts clear, scalable goals with immediate and long-term rewards that are integral to gameplay and player achievements. | Players feel unmotivated or the rewards feel disconnected from their efforts. |
| Progress & Feedback | Provides timely, personalized feedback linked to player actions, using various communication methods judiciously. | Players feel lost or inundated with irrelevant information, impacting their engagement. |
| Depth & Pacing | Manages the complexity and challenge progression, adapting to player skills to maintain interest and fairness. | Gameplay feels monotonous or unevenly challenging, affecting different player groups. |

### Progression

The frameworks that allow players to accrue long-term value and retain in a world (achievements, identify, items, etc.).

| Main Competency | Description | Focus Here If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-term Goals & Rewards | Sets compelling, overarching objectives that give players a reason to invest in the game over the long-term. | Players complete initial content quickly and eventually stagnate or lose interest without any clear path forward. |
| Layered Rewards | Distributes rewards at varying intervals to maintain interest and reward continual engagement. | Players feel over- or underwhelmed by the frequency of rewards, or that upcoming rewards are too distant. |
| Session Triggers | Implements mechanisms and incentives that actively encourage players to return for future sessions. | Players exhibit sporadic play patterns without regular engagement. |
| Community | Fosters identity and community so that players can adopt unique styles of play, express themselves, and build relationships. | Players feel isolated or uninvolved in the game’s community/social aspects. |

## Project Management

Involves a structured approach to transforming creative concepts into executable projects with clear goals and timelines, corresponding to roles in product, project, or program management.

### Product Management

The frameworks for turning ideas into practical, executable projects with clear goals, timelines, and deliverables.

| Main Competency | Description | Focus Here If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product Metrics Theory | Players feel isolated or uninvolved in the game’s community/social aspects. | You’re uncertain about how lifecycle stages impact each other and need strategies to effectively manage player engagement, reduce churn, and re-engage former players. |
| Goals | Sets clear, strategic objectives that are in strict alignment with the project’s mission and vision. This ensures every phase and task contributes directly to the overarching goals, streamlining efforts and resources. | Your project suffers from lack of direction, conflicting priorities, or stalls due to unresolved strategic questions. |
| Milestones | Establishes specific, measurable checkpoints that not only signify significant achievements but also enable structured evaluations at critical points, allowing for proactive adjustments to the project plans. | There are (frequent) misjudgments in project progress, necessitating last-minute changes or extensive reworks. Additionally, there’s a need to boost team morale by celebrating key successes. |
| Tasks | Employs robust tracking tools to manage and clearly visualize task progression and responsibilities across teams. Each task is defined with specific objectives, assigned responsibilities, and set deadlines to ensure systematic project execution. | You encounter challenges in prioritizing tasks or tracking progress, leading to uncertainties about achieving milestones and causing disorganization that impacts the project timeline. |
| Feedback | Actively solicits and integrates feedback from both users and stakeholders throughout the development cycle, ensuring it informs the milestone reviews and subsequent project adjustments. | Critical issues frequently surface too late in the development process or post-release, adversely affecting user and stakeholder satisfaction and retention. |

### Content Development

The processes to ensure an idea is clear and “proven” before moving to the long stage of polished script and art creation

| Main Competency | Description | Focus Here If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-production | Prototypes, iterates, and refines mechanics within a vertical slice to ensure the mechanics and core loop are engaging and fun. Decisions on art style and level of polish are finalized early to avoid costly changes after significant development has begun. | You aren’t familiar with “greyboxing” or “vertical slices.” Projects lack clearly proven or fun mechanics; there’s uncertainty whether the core experience will engage users; or art style and polish decisions are made too late, leading to significant changes after development. |
| Production | Expands on concepts proven in pre-production, fully developing all game elements including levels, story, and additional mechanics. Integrates all components into a cohesive whole, maintaining consistency and adhering to the project timeline and budget. | The scope of your worlds are (often) not fully realized or cohesive (at all, or late in the process), with elements that were introduced in pre-production not effectively being expanded or integrated or with large changes being made late in development. |
| Release | Conducts final tests and quality checks; finalizes the launch strategy, ensuring a smooth rollout and a strong market entry. Prepares fast—follow fixes to address any immediate issues post-launch. | When creating your worlds there are (often) unresolved technical issues, or the launch preparation is lacking in strategy, marketing materials, or distribution plans. |
