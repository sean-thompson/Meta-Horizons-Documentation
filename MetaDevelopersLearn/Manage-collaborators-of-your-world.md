# Manage collaborators of your world

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/manage-collaborators-in-horizon)

Collaborators are people you can add to your world to build with you. Collaborators will have the same building capabilities as the original creator of the world, meaning that anyone added as a collaborator will be able to build, edit and change anything in that world.

To add a collaborator, a world must already have been created. Only the original creator of a world can add and manage collaborators.

## To add a collaborator to an unpublished world:

*   From your **Personal Menu**, select the **Create** icon.

*   Select **Drafts** and tap the worldâ€™s thumbnail photo. This will take you to the World Details page.

*   Select the **Three Dot** icon in the top right, then select **Manage Collaborators**.

*   Select **Add** to add someone as a collaborator.

To remove a collaborator, select **Remove** next to their name in your world details.
