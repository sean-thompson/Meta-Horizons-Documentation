# Manage reports for members-only worlds in Meta Horizon Worlds

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/members-only-worlds/manage-reports-members-only-worlds)

Members-only worlds are membership-based communities where like-minded people can come together and enjoy a shared experience. In order to join a members-only world, you must be sent an invite by a member of the world, or you must request to join a world and have your request approved by a creator or admin.

Reports within a members-only world help creators and assigned admins maintain a safe and fun environment by empowering them to shape the world’s culture and norms by allowing them to manage access and address issues quickly and effectively. Creators and admins can review reported incidents that are sent to them, and take enforcement actions related to the [Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences (CCVE)](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/) and world-specific rule violations, such as temporarily muting and temporarily or permanently removing someone from the world.

Learn how to [report someone](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/horizon/safety-and-privacy-in-horizon-worlds/report-someone-horizon-worlds/) in Meta Horizon Worlds.

## Receiving reports

Members of a members-only world can file reports that go directly to creators and admins for violations of the creator’s [world-specific rules](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/set-up-members-only-world) and for some violations of the CCVE. Reports for other violations will go directly to Meta. The reporting flow will indicate whether Meta or the creator and admin will receive the report. Unresolved member reports sent to a creator and admin of a members-only world will trigger Meta’s Community Management Support process.

When a world member reports an incident that goes to the creator and admin, the creator and admin have 7 days to resolve and close the report. If the report is not closed within 7 days, the creator and admin receive a warning to resolve the report.

If the report is still unresolved 14 days from the date when the report was first filed, the members-only world will become hidden (this only applies to [visible members-only worlds](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/set-up-members-only-world) ). Each subsequent 72-hour period that the report remains unresolved will result in additional enforcement measures, up to requiring presence of an admin in the world, preventing new members from being added, and permanently unpublishing the world. However, once the report is closed, prior measures taken will incrementally lift in 3-day increments. **Note**: Meta will still respond to a select set of reported violations to help ensure world safety.

## Reviewing reports

Reports are generated when a member reports another member of the world. Creators and admins will receive a notification in Meta Horizon Worlds when a report is submitted. They can review reports by selecting the notification in Meta Horizon Worlds, or by visiting the Insights tab from the world details page.

To review reports:

*   From Meta Horizon Worlds, press the **Menu** button on your left Touch controller to open the Worlds menu.

*   Select **Create**.

*   Hover over the world you want to review and select **Insights**.

*   Select **Reports**.

From here, creators and admins can review reports, take actions against reported members, and close reports.

## Taking action on reports

Creators and admins can take action on a report by selecting **More actions** from the report details screen. The following actions are available:

*   **Mute**: temporarily mute the reported member in the world for 2 hours.

*   **Remove**: temporarily restrict reported member from entering the world for 2 hours.

*   **Revoke access**: only creators can permanently block reported members from entering the world. If the world is hidden, the blocked member will also no longer be able to search for it.

## Closing reports

Creators and admins can close a report by selecting **Close this report** from the report details screen. As a reminder, failure to close a report in a timely fashion will trigger Meta’s Community Management Support process as described above.

Once a report is closed, it cannot be reopened. Closed reports will appear under the **Closed reports** tab for 30 days after they are submitted.
