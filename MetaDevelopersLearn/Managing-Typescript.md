# Managing Typescript

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/managing-typescript)

The Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor requires TypeScript version 4.7.4 when creating or editing scripts. This topic shows you how to tell which version you have and to install TypeScript if you donâ€™t have it yet. **Note**: The Meta Horizon Worlds documentation cannot be considered the conclusive version of documentation for TypeScript itself, as Meta does not control the development of TypeScript. For the most up-to-date documentation on it, please see the [TypeScript home page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) .

For more information about the mechanics of TypeScript, see [About TypeScript](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/about-typescript/) **To check your installed version of TypeScript**

*   From the command line, enter the following command:
    
    ```
    tsc - v;
    ``` **To install version 4.7.4 of TypeScript** *   Install Typescript version 4.7.4 on your computer from the [Visual Studio marketplae](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.typescript-474) .
