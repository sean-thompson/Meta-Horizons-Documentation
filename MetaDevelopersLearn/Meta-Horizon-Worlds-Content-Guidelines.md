# Meta Horizon Worlds Content Guidelines

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/restrictions-to-worlds-in-horizon)

Our Content Guidelines help keep Meta Horizon Worlds a fun and welcoming place for everyone.

These guidelines include how worlds, events, and digital goods such as avatar clothing are rated, and who can publish different types of content while in Meta Horizon Worlds.

## How are worlds rated?

Every world and event gets a rating in Meta Horizon Worlds. That rating tells people who the space is generally appropriate for (like people ages 10 and up). Before a creator publishes a world or event, they must complete a survey telling us what’s in the world or event so that they can get a rating. If the world or event has content in it that wasn’t included in the survey, we may change its rating for accuracy, unpublish it or delete it.

## What are the different ratings?

There are 3 different ratings, each created with industry standards in mind:

*   **Ages 10+**: These worlds and events are appropriate for ages 10 and up. They may have mild language, minimal suggestive themes, and/or cartoon, fantasy, or mild violence.

*   **Ages 13+**: These worlds and events are appropriate for ages 13 and up and may have violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language.

*   **Ages 18+**: These worlds and events are generally appropriate for people ages 18 and up and may include intense violence, sexual content, strong language and/or regulated goods like tobacco or alcohol. Creators can also give their worlds this rating if they only want adults ages 18 and up to be able to see and visit their world.

## Who can publish different worlds?

There are different rules for who can publish worlds or events depending on the rating.

*   Ages 10+: Anyone can publish content with this rating.

*   Ages 13+: Anyone ages 13 and up can publish content with this rating. Children ages 10-12 can also publish content with this rating, but they need to get permission from their parents first.

*   Ages 18+: Only people ages 18 and up can publish content with this rating.

Ratings may appear differently in some regions. Visit the Help Center to learn more about how our Content Guidelines apply to worlds, and for more info on how to take the world rating survey.

## How digital goods are rated

Every digital good in Meta Horizon Worlds receives a rating indicating its suitability for different age groups. Creators must select an age rating when publishing an item, which is then visible to all users with access to an appropriate age group. Inaccurate ratings may result in unpublishing of the item.

Digital goods ratings and publishing rules mirror those of world ratings. For now, all items must be 10+ rated.

*   **Ages 10+**: These digital items must be appropriate for ages 10 and up. They may have mild language, minimal suggestive themes, and/or cartoon, fantasy, or mild violence. Items may not contain strong language, strong suggestive themes, or blood/gore.

## What’s not allowed in Meta Horizon Worlds?

In addition to what’s not allowed under the [Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/) , we don’t allow public worlds and events to have content that:

*   Is sexually explicit or provocative, including nudity, depictions of people in explicit positions, or content or worlds that are sexually provocative or implied

*   Depicts or promotes the use of illegal drugs or abuse of prescription drugs

*   Promotes criminal or dangerous activity

*   Depicts real-life violent and graphic content, including blood and gore

*   Attempts to buy, sell or trade real life regulated goods such as firearms, blades, alcohol or tobacco
