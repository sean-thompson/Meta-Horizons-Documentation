Important

This content is intended as a companion to the tutorial world of the same name, which you can access through the desktop editor. When you open the tutorial world, a copy is created for you to explore, and this page is opened so that you can follow along. For more information, see [Access Tutorial Worlds](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/access-tutorial-worlds) .

## Overview

Welcome! This world extends the basic Build your first game tutorial world with the following features:

*   **Scripted Avatar NPCs**: You can now deploy humanoid NPCs into your world, which are visually designed through a web interface. Additionally, you can apply scripted behaviors to the NPCs with basic APIs for:
    
    *   Locomotion
    
    *   Spawning and despawning
    
    *   Grabbing entities
    
    *   Jumping

*   **Quests**: You can design one or more goals in your world, which can be used to encourage engagement and replay of the experience.

*   **Voice-over**: This world also provides a simple mechanism for adding voice-over audio for your NPCs, bringing character and personality to the experience.

## Scripted Avatar NPCs

This world contains two scripted avatar NPCs:

| Village Elder | Traveling Merchant |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| The village has lost its gems! The Village Elder asks you, the player, for help in locating them. He, too, will look for them with you. | The Traveling Merchant is interested in gems, too. He will trade gems for coins and may stir things up with the Village Elder. |

The behaviors of these NPCs is managed through the `NPCManager.ts` script. Behaviors include:

*   Following NavMesh paths.
    
    *   For the Village Elder, this pathway is a route to collect gems.
    
    *   For the Traveling Merchant, this pathway is to collect gems and return them to their original location.

*   Spawning: Both characters spawn in.

*   Jumping: The Village Elder jumps for joy.

*   Grabbing: Both characters can grab and drop gems.

*   “Talking”: There are audio assets for both characters, which are triggered for playback based on actions tracked in `NPCManager.ts`.

For more information on how this works, see [Module 2 - Overview of Scripted Avatar NPCs](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/scripted-avatar-npc-tutorial/module-2-overview) .

## Quests

In the world are four quests. A **quest** is a world-based objective, which can be tied to player activities. For example, this world contains multiple quests for collecting gems and one for collecting a coin, which requires the player to explore the world, find the custom UI, and exchange a gem for a coin. A quest’s status is specific to an individual player.

*   Quests are data entities defined for the world in the Desktop Manager.

*   An instance of the Quests gizmo is deployed to allow players to track their progress toward completion of the quests.

*   Quest activities are managed through the `QuestManager.ts` script.

For more information on how the quests of the world operate, see [Module 5 - Quest Manager](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/scripted-avatar-npc-tutorial/module-5-quest-manager) .

For more information on the feature, see [Quests, leaderboards, and variable groups](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/quests-leaderboards-and-variable-groups/quests-leaderboards-and-variable-groups) .

## Limitations **Note**: This world supports single player only. Code examples should work in multiplayer environments, but some modifications should be expected.

## Prerequisites

If you have not previously used a tutorial world, you should verify that you meet the requirements for exploring these worlds. For more information, see [Tutorial Prerequisites](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/tutorial-prerequisites) .

### Build your first game

This world extends from the Build your first game tutorial world. Although it is not required, you may learn quite a bit by first exploring this other world. For more information, see [Module 1 - Build your first game](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/build-your-first-game/module-1-build-your-first-game) .

## Use in Your World
