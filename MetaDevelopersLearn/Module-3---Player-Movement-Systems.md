# Module 3 - Player Movement Systems

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/horizon-traversal-sample-world/module-3-player-movement-systems)

This game utilizes fairly standard movement patterns in VR, except for two key game features:

*   **Double-jump**: players can jump and then re-jump in mid-air.

*   **Boost jump**: When a player crosses through a ring in the game, boost jump is re-charged, which allows the player a single super-jump.
    
    *   After landing, the player cannot boost jump again until the player crosses through a ring. The player can cross through the same ring to recharge.

These special controls require separate properties and calculations based on those properties and the player’s:

*   current position and velocity

*   input from their controls, whether in VR/mobile/Desktop. We take the inputs and normalize them before using them for the above.

## PlayerControllerManager.ts

Manages the local player control inputs, initializing them and managing ownership. Also, provides an interface for setting double-jump, boost-jump, and boost-jump angle properties. **Notes**:

*   When this script is attached to an entity in the world, you can modify in the Properties panel the values for double-jump and boost-jump properties:
    
    *   doubleJumpAmount
    
    *   boostJumpAmount
    
    *   boostJumpAngle
    
    *   **Tip**: You can set new default values in the code or modify property values through the Properties panel.

*   preStart():
    
    *   Registers listeners for onPlayerEnterWorld and onPlayerExitWorld CodeBlock events. Call private handlers in both cases.
    
    *   Creates a network broadcast event listener for the onGetPlyrCtrlData network event. When the event is received, the local player’s control data and jump property values are broadcast.

*   start():
    
    *   When player enters the world:
        
        *   Player jump controls are registered in the CtrlPool, which manages mapping of controls for individual players.
    
    *   When player exits the world:
        
        *   A lookup is performed by player.id to locate the jump controls for the player in the CtrlPool and to remove them.

## PlayerControllerLocal.ts

Local Script that takes the Players input and allows for doublejump and boost jumping. Additionally, for responsiveness of game effects, it also plays SFX and VFX for players. **Notes**:

*   preStart() and start() methods segment between local player and server player. If this Local script is executing on a client that is not the server, then the script owner (this.owner) can be presumed to be a player, and the private preStart() and start() handers are used.

*   localPreStart():
    
    *   Connects inputs for double-jump (this.connectDoubleJumpInputs()) and boost jump (this.connectBoostJumpInputs())
    
    *   Connects properties for sound effects and visual effects to internal variables for playback as needed.
    
    *   Creates network hz.EventSubscription objects for local player events:
        
        *   this.playerGotBoostSub
        
        *   this.setJumpCtrlDataSub
        
        *   this.onPlayerOOBSub
        
        *   When these events occur, the local player data is sent across the network to update other entities.

*   localStart():
    
    *   Private functions for connectDoubleJumpInputs() and connectBoostJumpInputs() map player input controls and icons for the two game functions and create callbacks.
    
    *   connectDoubleJumpInputs() creates a callback function which manages the first and second jump of a double jump, by calculating velocity and angle of the jump, as well as playing back SFX.
    
    *   connectBoostJumpInputs() creates a callback to calculate the boost jump vector using the private function getBoostVectorBasedOnInput(), which performs the vector calculations.

Some calculations use functions defined in MathUtils.ts.
