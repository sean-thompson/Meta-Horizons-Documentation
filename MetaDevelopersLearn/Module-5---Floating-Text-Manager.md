# Module 5 - Floating Text Manager

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/chop-n-pop-sample-world/module-5-floating-text-manager)

The Floating Text Manager system can be used to display floating text elements in the game for a short period of time. In Chop ‘N Pop: Graveyard Bash, these text elements appear over an enemy to indicate the effect of a hit on it. **Note**: The ammo counter displayed over the guns is a simple Text gizmo.

Floating Text Manager is composed of two scripts and a predefined Text Gizmo asset, which is spawned in whenever a piece of floating text is required.

In this world, the `createFloatingText()` method in Floating Text Manager is invoked in the `NPCAgent.ts` script when an npcHit is triggered from an axeHit or bulletHit. As a result of a hit, `createFloatingText()` generates a piece of floating text bubbling up from the point of impact, displaying the amount of damage done by the hit. This amount of damage is applied to a spawned text gizmo using the `setText()` method in `FloatingText.ts`. This piece of floating text exists for a predefined period of time, before the Text gizmo is deleted, causing the text to disappear.

## System Components **FloatingTextManager.ts**:

This script is attached to the WorldInstances > FloatingTextManager reference object.

Script properties are the defaults for any new floating text entity. Properties:

```
static propsDefinition = {
  floatingTextAsset : {type: PropTypes.Asset, default: undefined},
  yPos : {type: PropTypes.Number, default: 2},
  floatSpeed : {type: PropTypes.Number, default: 0.5},
  rotationSpeed : {type: PropTypes.Number, default: 360},
  duration : {type: PropTypes.Number, default: 2.0},
  color : {type: PropTypes.Color, default: new Color(1, 1, 1)}
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| floatingTextAsset | Asset in your Asset Library that corresponds to a predefined Text Gizmo asset, in which its properties have been set to create the proper appearance in the world. |
| yPos | Y-coordinate offset from the entity from which the new floating text element is spawned. |
| floatSpeed | When a floating text element is spawned, it drifts upward. This value defines the speed of the drift in meters per second. |
| rotationSpeed | You can define a rotational speed if needed |
| duration | Time in seconds that the floating text element should live, before it is destroyed. |
| color | Color of the displayed text. |

The `createFloatingText()` function is invoked from `NpcAgent.ts` whenever an axe or bullet strikes an NPC.

Script dependencies:

*   `Behaviour.ts`

*   `FloatingText.ts` **FloatingText.ts**:

This script is attached to the spawned Text gizmo asset and manages two functions:

*   `setText()`
    
     specifies the text that appears in the gizmo to which it is attached.

*   `update()`
    
     is a world event that occurs every frame. This event updates the position and rotation of the floating text based on the specified parameters for it.
    
    *   When the duration in seconds for the text gizmo has been exceeded, the text gizmo is deleted.

Script dependencies:

*   `Behaviour.ts` **Text Gizmo**:

In Chop ‘N Pop: Graveyard Bash, the FloatingTextManager script property for floatingTextAsset links to an asset called FloatingDamage, which is an asset that is composed of:

*   Text Gizmo that has been configured to display red numbers.

*   `FloatingText.ts`
    
     script that has been attached to the Text Gizmo. **Tip**: You can make your own in your own world.

## How to Deploy

*   Copy the text of the scripts and their dependent scripts into scripts that you create in your world.

*   Create a FloatingTextManager reference object. Attach `FloatingTextManager.ts` to it.

*   Add in a Text Gizmo. Configure it to display the text in a format that you prefer. Attach `FloatingText.ts` to it.

*   Create an asset out of your configured Text gizmo.

*   In `FloatingTextManager.ts` properties, select this asset for the floatingTextAsset property.

For more information, see “Deploying Systems” in [Module 1 - Setup](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/chop-n-pop-sample-world/module-1-setup) .

## How to Use

In your code, wherever you need to display floating text, call createFloatingText function in `FloatingTextManager.ts` like the following:

```
FloatingTextManager.instance?.createFloatingText(myString, hitPosition, textColor);
```

## Modifications

### Multiple FloatingText instances

To create a second type of floating text, copy the `FloatingText.ts` script, rename it, and attach it to a second Text gizmo. You can then change behaviors of individual floating text by modifying parameters in the `FloatingText.ts` script.

```
private floatSpeed: number = 1;
private rotateSpeed: number = 360;
private currentTime = 0;
private maxTime: number = 2;
private rotationEuler = new Vec3(0, 0, 0);
private deleted = false;
```

These values can be used to override the defaults specified in the `FloatingTextManager.ts` script.

## Summary

This module covers the system for triggering floating text elements to appear in the game for a few seconds before disappearing. In Chop ‘N Pop: Graveyard Bash, this system is used for displaying damage to an enemy after a weapon strike.

You can modify this system to make floating text appear wherever needed in your game.
