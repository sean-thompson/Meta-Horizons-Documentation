# Module 5 - Summary

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/spawning-and-pooling-in-typescript/module-5-summary)

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Spawning and Pooling in TypeScript tutorial world.

We have covered the primary spawning options available in Meta Horizon Worlds, including proper usage and trade-offs and considerations for each option.

*   **Simple object spawning**: Spawning in objects one-by-one is easy to implement but is slow. This method is suitable for small numbers of assets and simpler assets.

*   **Object pooling**: Assets can be spawned into an off-camera pooling location from which they can be moved into the world experience as needed. However, these assets still exist in the world, require management, and consume resources.

*   **SpawnController**: At startup, you can load assets into SpawnController objects, which makes them readily available for spawning. When needed, they can be quickly spawned or unloaded from the world--and reloaded again if needed.

Visit the Complete world to try out the end-to-end experience! The two spawn options are placed side-by-side, so you can easily compare them.

## Extending the Tutorial

You can explore the following ideas for expanding on this tutorial.

### One array

It may be more efficient to turn `objList[]` and `objectPool[]` into a single multi-dimensional array. You could add a flag `inUse` to the array to determine if the entity is being used in the world at any time.

### Multiple asset types

You can expand the array(s) to enable use of multiple asset types. Asset types can be referenced by:

*   Properties in the Properties panel (current method)

*   Hard-coded asset IDs. These values must be captured to BigInt data type in your code and referenced using the asset.id property.

*   JSON data loaded from an external resource can include other useful information, such as loadOnStart, maxEntities, and even previously undefined values like maxHitPoints.
