# Module 7 - Collecting Gems and Keeping Score

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/build-your-first-game/module-7-collecting-gems-and-keeping-score)

## Endgame

Reviewing our Game Design requirements:

*   The Finished state should be triggered automatically after the player has collected all gems.

#### Solution

*   When a player collides with a gem, it is collected. The gem is hidden, and we increment a counter.

*   The game is over when all gems (5) have been collected.

Building the solution with a separation of concerns in mind helps to keep our game easy to manage.

*   A single gem *should be* responsible for managing itself when a collision occurs. For example, it should move, or it should change color, or it should take damage, etc. It should send messages of changes in status as needed.

*   A single gem *should NOT be* responsible for knowing about all other gems in the world and keeping track of the gem collecting progress. Updating changes on all gems could get difficult and become buggy.

*   Our `GameManager` is meant to manage the state and flow of the game, and it already knows how many gems are in the world. This component *should be* the single source of truth for how many gems have been collected (game state).

Each gem already has a `hiddenLocation` variable that we can use to move a gem off of the course. That’s part of the solution.

However, we do not have a way for gems to communicate to our `GameManager` yet. In theory, we could add the `GameManager` as a component prop to the `GemController` script and send a direct entity event. This would work. But what if there are other components that need to know when a gem is collected?

Possible examples:

*   A scoreboard needs to know.

*   An audio system needs to know.

*   Enemies need to know so they can move faster.

We could end up with a long list of prop dependencies that we would need to connect on every single gem. That doesn’t work.

For our situation, **broadcast events** work best. Our new to-do list for when a collision event is fired on a gem is:

*   In `GemController`, have the *gem* move itself to its `hiddenLocation`.

*   In `GemController`, have the *gem* send a new `gemCollected` broadcast event.

*   Have the *Game Manager* subscribe to the `gemCollected` event.

*   Have the *Game Manager* keep a `totalGemsCollected` value.

The next sections describe how to execute these tasks. However, we have already learned how to do them! If you’re up for it, you can try it yourself and then check the final `GameManager` and `GemController` scripts, which are included here and in the tutorial world.

## Keeping score in GameManager

In the `GameManager` script, add a new private variable: `totalGemsCollected`. This variable keeps track of the game’s progress.

The new `totalGemsCollected` variable could be a number that we increment by 1 each time we receive the event. That could work. However, it does not prevent the possibility of us accidentally counting the same gem twice. Additionally, if our game is expanded to collect things other than gems or has more complex win states, a simple incrementing variable is inadequate.

Instead, let’s use a Map object here, and add gems when they are collected. After a gem has been added, it cannot be added again, which is an easy way to prevent duplicate counts. Add the following near the top of the `start()` method in the `GameManager` script:

```
private totalGemsCollected: Map<bigint, hz.Entity> = new Map<bigint, hz.Entity>();
```

Still in the `GameManager` script, we must create another new event. This broadcast event is published by each collected gem, and the `GameManager` connects to it to listen for it. As part of the execution of the event, we want to add each gem to our Map variable. We must pass the gem entity data, along with the event:

```
export const collectGem = new hz.LocalEvent<{gem: hz.Entity}>('collectGem');
```

Now, in the `start()` module of the `GameManager` component, subscribe to the event:

```
this.connectLocalBroadcastEvent(collectGem, (data: {gem: hz.Entity}) => {
  this.handleGemCollect(data.gem);
});
```

Create the `handleGemCollect()` event handler. Inside of the event handler, check if the gem has already been collected. If not, add it:

```
private handleGemCollect(gem: hz.Entity): void {
  if (!this.totalGemsCollected.has(gem.id)) {
    this.totalGemsCollected.set(gem.id, gem);
  }
}
```

When all gems have been collected, the game state is supposed to be updated, which we can address in this same event handler.

Each time a gem is added to our `totalGemsCollected` map, check to see if we have collected all gems in our gems array ( `this.gems` ). The complete `handleGemCollect` method now looks like the following:

```
private handleGemCollect(gem: hz.Entity): void {
  if (!this.totalGemsCollected.has(gem.id)) {
    this.totalGemsCollected.set(gem.id, gem);
  }
  if (this.totalGemsCollected.size === this.gems.length) {
    this.setGameState(GameState.Finished);
  }
}
```

Note the different properties for checking size between the Map ( `size` ) and the array ( `length` ).

To ensure replay, we should reset the count of `totalGemsCollected` when the game starts. In the GameManager class, add a new class method in `GameManager` called `onGameStateReady`, which clears the `totalGemsCollected` map.

```
private onGameStateReady(): void {
   this.totalGemsCollected.clear();
};
```

The above method must be called. In the `switch` statement in the `setGameState` function, call `onGameStateReady`.

```
case GameState.Ready:
  if (this.gameState !== GameState.Playing) {
    this.gameState = GameState.Ready;
    this.onGameStateReady();
  }
  break;
```

That’s it for the `GameManager` part of our to-do list, we can move to the `GemController` script.

## Manage gem collection - GemController

In the `GemController` script, add the `collectGem` event to the imports:

```
import {moveGemToCourse, collectGem} from 'GameManager';
```

Now, update the `handleCollision` method so that it moves the gem to the `hiddenLocation`, after which it emits a `collectGem` broadcast event:

```
private handleCollision(): void {
    this.entity.position.set(this.hiddenLocation);
    this.sendLocalBroadcastEvent(
      collectGem,
      {gem: this.entity},
    );
  }
```

## Complete GemController script

The complete `GemController` script now looks like the following:

```
import * as hz from '@horizon/core';
import {moveGemToCourse, collectGem} from 'GameManager';

class GemController extends hz.Component<typeof GameController> {
  static propsDefinition = {
    coursePositionRef: {type: hz.PropTypes.Entity},
  };

  private hiddenLocation = new hz.Vec3(0, -100, 0);

  start() {
    this.entity.position.set(this.hiddenLocation);

    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
      this.entity,
      hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerCollision,
      (collidedWith: hz.Player) => {
        this.handleCollision();
      },
    );

    this.connectLocalEvent(this.entity, moveGemToCourse, () => {
      this.onMoveGemToCourseEvent();
    });
  }

  private handleCollision(): void {
    this.entity.position.set(this.hiddenLocation);
    this.sendLocalBroadcastEvent(collectGem, {gem: this.entity});
  }
  private onMoveGemToCourseEvent(): void {
    this.entity.position.set(this.props.coursePositionRef!.position.get());
  }
}
hz.Component.register(GemController);
```

### Testing

You can verify that gem collecting and state updates are working correctly by logging state changes from the `GameManager` script to the console ( `console.log` ).

Then, check the console output during gameplay:

Hooray!

## Resetting the game

Let’s enable replay, over and over again!

We made it easy to manage and change game states, so resetting the game should not be too hard. Let us make it possible to return the game back to the initial Ready state.

To trigger a game reset, we can follow our pattern from earlier when we manually triggered game start. Here are the next steps we need to complete:

*   Add a new **Trigger Zone gizmo** to the Reset platform area in the provided course.

*   Create a new script named `ResetGameTrigger`. Attach it to the Trigger Zone.

*   Connect the `ResetGameTrigger` script to the `OnPlayerEnterTrigger` Code Block Event and then broadcast our existing `setGameState` event with the Ready state.

### Results

These steps are repeats of things we have learned, so let’s skip straight to the results.

A new Trigger Zone with an attached `ResetGameTrigger` script:

The new `ResetGameTrigger` script:

```
import * as hz from 'horizon/core';
import {GameState, setGameState} from 'GameManager';

class ResetGameTrigger extends hz.Component<typeof ResetGameTrigger> {
  static propsDefinition = {};

  start() {
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
      this.entity,
      hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger,
      (enteredBy: hz.Player) => {
        this.handleOnPlayerEnter();
      },
    );
  }

  private handleOnPlayerEnter(): void {
    this.sendLocalBroadcastEvent(setGameState, {state: GameState.Ready});
  }
}

hz.Component.register(ResetGameTrigger);
```

Our game can now be played over and over again! Players can start the game, collect all coins, trigger the game to reset, and then trigger the game to start again. **Note**: In this implementation, the `ResetGameTrigger` works only if all gems have been collected and the game is in a Finished state. As an exercise, you can look to modify or improve the code to support reset in states other than Finished.

## Checkpoint

*   At this point you have built a complete game!

*   In the next module we are going to add a scoreboard that displays the game state and the number of gems collected during gameplay, but you can stop here if you like.

*   The components you have built in this tutorial are the foundation for many great experiences in Meta Horizon Worlds.
