# NPC gizmo

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/npc-gizmo)

A [Non-Playable Character](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npcs) (NPC) in Worlds is a character that is not controlled by a player but is instead programmed to perform certain actions or behaviors. NPCs can enhance the interactivity and immersion of virtual worlds by providing dynamic interactions and responses to players. They can be used for various purposes. NPCs in Worlds can be customized and controlled using scripts, allowing creators to define their behaviors, interactions, and appearances. This customization is often done using tools like the [NPC gizmo](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npc-gizmo) along with scripting, which enable creators to integrate NPCs into their worlds and enhance the overall user experience.

## Limitations

There are [limitations](https://github.com/MHCPCreators/horizonCreatorManual/blob/main/HorizonTechnicalDoc.md#npc-gizmo) while using the NPC gizmo.

## Access the NPC gizmo

While you can access and configure the gizmos in the [VR tool](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon) , the following steps show you how to access the NPC gizmo from the desktop editor and add it to the scene pane.

*   In the desktop editor while in the Build mode, select **Build** \> **Gizmos** from the menu bar, search for “npc” in the search field.
    

*   Select the NPC gizmo and drag it into the scene.
    

*   You can now edit the new gizmo properties in the **Properties** panel.
    

For additional tutorials on how to access and use the gizmo, see [Create scripted avatar NPC](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/scripted-avatar-npcs/create-scripted-avatar-npc) .

## Properties

The NPC gizmo is an entity. All objects in a world are represented by entities. [Entities](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity) have their respective properties such as position, rotation, and scale. In the **Properties** panel, you can edit the gizmo’s transformation fields to configure its **Position**, 

**Rotation**, and **Scale**.

For descriptions of the additional NPC gizmo properties, see [NPC gizmo](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/npc-gizmo) .

## Scripts

To customize the behavior of your NPC gizmo through scripting, see [API overview of scripted avatar NPCs](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/scripted-avatar-npcs/api-overview-for-scripted-avatar-npcs) . See also [Getting started with scripted avatar NPCs](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/npcs/scripted-avatar-npcs/getting-started-with-scripted-avatar-npcs) .
