This two part video series covers beginner to intermediate skills and will equip us with methods to increase the versatility and capacity of our Meta Horizon creations using asset spawning. @SeeingBlue will guide us through dynamically spawning and despawning assets in our worlds, and best practices for sending information between assets.

In Part One, SeeingBlue walks us through the different codeblocks we will use.
