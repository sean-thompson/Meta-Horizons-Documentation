[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/community-tutorials/custom-ui-weekly-challenge)

This challenge introduces you to the process of creating a Custom UI (User Interface) in Horizon Worlds, even if you have never scripted with TypeScript before! Custom UI is a React-based feature that allows you to display dynamic and enriched content, display images, and receive inputs from users.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

*   Find and implement the Custom UI Gizmo

*   Add a Custom UI oriented script to the world (using TypeScript)

*   Apply basic formatting to a Custom UI

*   Upload textures to display on CUIs

*   Display an Image on a CUI
