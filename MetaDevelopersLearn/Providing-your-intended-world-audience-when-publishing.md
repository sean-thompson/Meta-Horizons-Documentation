# Providing your intended world audience when publishing

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/intended-world-audience)

As a Horizon Creator, you’re all about crafting amazing experiences for your community. To help us better understand who you worlds are designed for, you are required to identify the intended audience as an additional step before publishing or republishing your world. This quick and easy step will help ensure that your creations reach the right people and provide age-appropriate experiences for everyone.

## Determining your world’s intended audience

To determine the intended audience for your world, review the [FTC Guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#D.%20Websites%20and%20Online%20Services) and consider a world’s subject matter. This includes visual, character choices, child-oriented activities or incentives, music or other audio content, language, and use of child models.

You may also evaluate empirical evidence regarding audience composition or appeal to determine which intended audience group is most accurate.

You are required to indicate your world’s intended audience as part of the [World Rating Survey](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/mhcp-program/policy-and-legal/world-ratings-survey) before the world can be published.

## How to provide your world’s intended audience information

In the world rating survey, you’ll be prompted to select your world’s intended audience from the following options:

*   **Unrestricted audience**:
    
    *   Teens and Adults (13+ or applicable age in user’s region): For worlds that are for users 13-years-old or older.
    
    *   Mixed Ages (under 13 or applicable age in user’s region, and 13+): For worlds that are for children under 13-years-old (ages 10-12) and for teen and adult users (13+).
    
    *   Children (under 13 or applicable age in user’s region): For worlds that are intended primarily for children under 13 (10-12 year olds). User data from these worlds may not be shared with Meta.

*   **Restricted audience**:
    
    *   Adults (18+ or applicable age in user’s region): For worlds that are for adults only.

You can update this information at any time if your world’s intended audience changes.

## Intended audience vs world rating

*   **World rating**: Dictates who can see and access your world based on content guidelines.

*   **Intended audience**: Helps us understand who you’re designing your world for, ensuring users have relevant experiences.

Intended audience information largely provides no impact to world rating, with the exception of choosing “Restricted audience,” which will override the world rating to 18+ and restrict access to adults only.

## Frequently asked questions **Q: When is the intended audience survey available and where can I find it? Approximately how long will it take me to complete?** A: The survey will be available beginning May 19, 2025. You can access the survey by going to Build mode and choosing your world. In the **Publish** panel under **World Rating**, select **Get rating** (or the current rating shown). You will be prompted to choose the intended audience. This should take no longer than a few minutes to complete. **Q: By when do I need to complete the intended audience survey?** A: You will need to complete the step the first time you publish or republish a world on and after May 19, 2025. After you complete this for the first time, consider retaking it if your target audience has significantly changed.
