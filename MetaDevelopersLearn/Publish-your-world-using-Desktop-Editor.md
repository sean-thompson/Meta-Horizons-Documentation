## About the world ratings survey

*   You are required to complete the world ratings survey when you first publish a world and it should be retaken whenever you make significant changes to a world’s content.

*   Only those above 18 can publish worlds that contain content covered by the [Horizon Mature Worlds Policy](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/restrictions-to-worlds-in-horizon) .

*   If the survey doesn’t account for certain aspects of your world content that affect its rating, we may change the rating, unpublish, or remove the world.

## To unpublish a world

To unpublish a world using the Desktop Editor:

*   Open the Desktop Editor and select the world to publish from the Creation Home.

*   Open the Creator menu at the upper left and choose **Publish World**, or click the **Publish** button at the upper right.

*   This opens the **Publish World** dialog. On the bottom right, above the **Publish** button, click the small **Unpublish** option.

*   In the confirmation dialog, click **Unpublish**.

You can also continue building in a world even after it’s been published without affecting the experience of anyone who’s currently in your world.
