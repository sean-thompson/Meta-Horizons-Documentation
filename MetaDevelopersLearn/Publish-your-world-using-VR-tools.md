In order to publish a world, you’ll need to provide pertinent information such as a name, description and thumbnail photo. This information helps people find your world and decide if they’d like to visit it and explore.

## To publish a world:

*   Go to Build Mode in the world to be published.

*   Open the Creator Menu.

*   Tap the **Publish** icon in the dock.

*   Enter your information into the **Publish World** window, including:

## About the world ratings survey

*   You are required to complete the world ratings survey when you first publish a world and it should be retaken whenever you make significant changes to a world’s content.

*   Only those above 18 can publish worlds that contain content covered by the [Horizon Mature Worlds Policy](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/restrictions-to-worlds-in-horizon) .

*   If the survey doesn’t account for certain aspects of your world content that affect its rating, we may change the rating, unpublish, or remove the world.

## To unpublish a world:

*   Go to the **Publish** section of your Creator Menu.

*   Tap **Publish Updates** to expand the dropdown.

*   Tap **Unpublish**.

*   Tap **Next**.

Once a world is published, it will appear in the **Places** section of your Personal Menu and anyone in Worlds will be able to search for and go to it.

You can also continue building in a world even after it’s been published without affecting the experience of anyone who’s currently in your world.

## To update a published world:

*   Go to the **Publish** section of your Creator Menu.

*   Tap the **Next** icon, then tap **Publish Updates**.

Anyone who’s currently in your world will need to leave and come back in order to see the updates.
