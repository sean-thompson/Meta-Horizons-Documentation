# Scripting Considerations

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/asset-spawning/scripting-considerations)

## Naming conflicts

When spawning content it is possible to attempt to load two different scripts with the same name causing a naming conflict. This can happen when a world contains a script and then spawns content containing a script with the same name, or if two pieces of content are spawned both containing scripts with the same name. For file-backed scripts worlds see the [documentation page](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/filebacked-scripts) for details on execution specifics. In other worlds all scripts will be executed. In both cases a warning will be logged to the scripting console.

If there is a naming conflict on a script that is imported from another script, the first loaded version of the imported script will get imported. For example, say there is a world containing a script called `Utils` and an asset containing a script called `Utils` and a script called `Component` which contains the line `import {Foo} from './Utils'`. If the world spawns that asset, when `Component` runs it will be importing from the `Utils` script in the world, not the asset.

In general it is recommended to avoid naming conflicts as they can lead to unexpected or difficult to understand behavior.
