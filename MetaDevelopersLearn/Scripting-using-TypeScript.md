The desktop editor is in early access and we need your feedback! To report bugs, go to the main menu and select **Report a problem**. To give us feedback, select **Help us improve** from the main menu.

Warning

Use of TypeScript and the Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor is limited to persons aged 13 and above. Meta reserves the right to conduct its own review of the information that a creator provides to determine whether the age group provided by the creator is accurate. Any misrepresentation of user's age group may result in rejection, suspension, or removal of that creator's account and/or world.

Scripting offers a way to add behaviors to objects in your world(s). Meta Horizon Worlds uses TypeScript as the basis for its scripting process, allowing you to write scripts more efficiently than using traditional programming processes and tools.

Typescript is a strongly-typed version of JavaScript, adding additional syntax to JavaScript to support integration with your editor. This, in turn, gives you better tooling and the ability to catch errors while youâ€™re developing your world rather than at runtime.
