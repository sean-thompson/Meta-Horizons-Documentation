# Set up a members-only world using VR tools [Members-only worlds](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/horizon/explore-horizon-worlds/members-only-worlds/) are membership-based communities where like-minded people can come together and enjoy a shared experience. In order to join a members-only world, you must be sent an invite by a member of the world, or you must request to join a world and have your request approved by a creator or admin.

## Create your members-only world

Members-only worlds are a new type of closed space, similar to [personal space](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/horizon/explore-horizon-worlds/personal-space-in-meta-horizon-worlds/) , that is membership-based. You can turn on the Members-only setting for a world you create once the standard world creation flow is complete and your world is ready to publish.

To turn on the Members-only setting for your world:

*   From the **Publish World** menu, turn on the **Members-only** setting.

*   Review the terms associated with members-only worlds, then select **Accept the Meta Horizon Worlds Moderation Terms**.
    
    *   If you do not accept these terms, you will not be able to enable members-only or publish a members-only world.

*   Once **Members-only** is turned on, the **Admin presence required** setting will become available.
    
    *   This setting is turned off by default, which means that members can visit the members-only world without an admin present.
    
    *   Turning this setting on means members cannot visit the members-only world without an admin present. **Note**: If a member attempts to enter a members-only world where admin presence is required and an admin is not present, a notification will appear explaining that the world is unavailable.

*   Set the preferred visibility of your members-only world:
    
    *   **Visible**: People can discover and request to join a members-only world. The world may be featured or appear in search results once it is published.
    
    *   **Hidden**: Only members are able to access the world. These worlds are not visible to others from the world menu and will not show up in search results once published.

Additional considerations for members-only worlds:

*   Once a world is designated a members-only world, it cannot be converted to a public world.

*   Members-only worlds can be duplicated, but the membership list and world privacy settings will not carry over to the new world.

*   Members-only worlds can currently support up to 150 members and 25 members visiting the world at a single time. **Note**: The maximum concurrent visitors will also depend on world capacity limits, so this may be lower than 25.

*   Collaborators (including testers, editors, and admins) are considered members and count towards the 150 world member cap and number of concurrent members.

*   Members-only worlds are restricted to a single instance.

## Set rules for a members-only world

World creators will determine what rules apply in their members-only world in addition to the [Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences (CCVE)](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/) . When accepting an invitation to join a members-only world, prospective members will be prompted to review and accept the world rules and CCVE before their membership is confirmed. Similarly, before a prospective member can request to join a members-only world, they must accept the world rules and CCVE. Whenever world rules are updated, members will see a prompt to review and accept the updated rules prior to entering the world.

Creators of members-only worlds can select rules from a preset library, or add custom rules to their worlds.

To set rules for a members-only world:

*   From Meta Horizon Worlds, press the **Menu** button on your left Touch controller to open the Worlds menu.

*   Select **World rules**.

*   Select **Add rules** and review the **Rules Library**.
    
    *   To add a custom rule to the library, select **Create new rule** and then **Add**. These rules will show up in your **Rules Library** under **Custom rules** and you can select, edit, or delete them.

*   Select **+** for each rule you want to apply to your members-only world.
    
    *   Once a rule is selected, a checkmark will display. Selecting that checkmark again will remove the rule from the members-only world.

## Invite members and select roles (tester, editor, admin)

World creators can invite members and collaborators to their members-only worlds by selecting **Invite People** from the **Manage People** menu. The world creator, members, and admins do not need to follow each other to be part of the same members-only world.

Members-only worlds feature a new type of collaborator role – admin. World members with this role can temporarily mute someone globally or temporarily remove members from the world. Admins cannot be removed via Poll to remove. World creators will remain the responsible party for anything that occurs in their world, so it is important to assign admin roles to members who are trusted and can confidently carry out their duties in creating a positive experience for all members.

Anyone invited to join a members-only world can hold a combination of the following roles:

*   **Member**: Can visit a published members-only world, but cannot modify or publish it.

*   **Collaborator**: A collaborator can be any combination of the following three different roles:
    
    *   **Tester**: Can go to an unpublished world, but can only review it. They can’t edit, copy, invite, manage collaboration or publish.
    
    *   **Editor**: Can go to an unpublished world, edit it, and view feedback. They can’t copy, invite, manage collaboration or publish.
    
    *   **Admin**: Can visit published worlds, but cannot modify them. Can temporarily mute or remove members from the world. Cannot be removed via Poll to remove.

World creators can update a member’s role by selecting the person in the **Manage People** menu. Selecting the **Invites** tab will display any pending invites.
