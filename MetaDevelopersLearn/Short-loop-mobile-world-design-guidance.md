## Introduction

The average mobile gaming session is 3-5 minutes, so shorter game loops that are progressible within that time frame tend to be more attractive to players. The option to progress quickly lowers barriers to entry in mobile games and virtual worlds.

Basic ways to create a short loop include:

*   Giving a short block of time in which an action can be completed

*   Using a timer or a countdown clock to create structure and a sense of urgency

*   Providing short challenges, such as a dress-up challenge or running through an obstacle course

*   Including mini games

*   Playing with repeatable concepts where future iterations allow the player to get different results, such as having a fortune read by a fortune teller

In this article, you will learn some best practices and design considerations for building short-loop mobile worlds.

## Design considerations

Keep the following design aspects in mind when creating your short-loop mobile world:

### Visibility

A dimly lit environment has been reported to be appealing in VR; however, darker games/experiences can be harder to see on a small screen. Additionally, written instructions, leaderboards, and object prices can be difficult to read.

Music Valley and Soapstone are examples of worlds that use calming, contrasting colors that are easy to see regardless of screen size. For mobile, consider:

*   Using contrasting colors that are easy to view on a smaller screen

*   Avoiding signage with lots of words

*   Conveying instructions and leaderboards in unique ways

### Audio

While 3D dynamic audio is important for an immersive VR environment, mobile game audio should focus more on clarity. Mobile users may be using headphones or built-in speakers, both have less sophisticated outputs than those found in VR headsets or high-end gaming PCs. This means that audio designers need to optimize their sound effects and music for a wider range of devices. For mobile, consider:

*   Ensuring high audio quality so players can hear what is going on in the world with headphones

*   Adding or highlighting multiple audio options

### UI and controls

While certain actions may feel intuitive in VR, the UI for mobile games needs to quickly communicate to players how to interact in the world. For mobile, consider:

*   Giving players an option to adjust the layout of inputs, and/or a variety of preset layouts

*   Ensuring button icons communicate the intended action clearly

### Game mechanics

Mobile players are often looking for a shorter gameplay experience, and games have limited controls due to screen size; therefore, straightforward game mechanics work best. For mobile, consider:

*   Straightforward but engaging core loops

*   Gameplay that hinges on social fun and does not dexterity or specific movements

*   Including mobile workarounds (like the rocket jump button in Citadel) when progressible

### Communication

Mobile users may be joining from a variety of locations; therefore, their willingness and ability to communicate verbally may vary. For mobile, consider:

*   Providing nonverbal ways for players to interact, express themselves, and communicate. For example:
    
    *   Custom emotes
    
    *   Custom avatar animations
    
    *   Triggering in-world objects
    
    *   Providing wearables to signify different statuses
    
    *   Including ways to show if players are open to others joining mini games

### Multitasking

Mixing play with other activities is common on mobile. While VR users are typically fully focused on the experience at hand, mobile users may log in for a more casual experience while doing other activities like watching TV, etc. Taking this into account, consider building worlds that allow for a “spectator mode,” and allow more flexibility for stopping and restarting as needed.

### On-the-go gaming

Mobile devices are always with us, making them convenient for quick gaming sessions regardless of location. Building worlds that are suitable for on-the-go play means considering design aspects such as convenient control layouts (for example, one-hand controls), a story that makes sense without sound, and being able to pause and start again as needed.

### Connecting with others

Many players join via mobile as a way to connect with friends. As Horizon Worlds is now accessible to everyone with a mobile phone, we may see individuals using this as a “more fun than a phone call” way to catch up with friends and family. Creating casual worlds that allow users to play in a relaxed way can appeal to these sorts of players.
