# Station 10 - Timer and Build Info Overlays

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/custom-ui-examples-tutorial/station-10-timer-and-build-info-overlays)

This station introduces the **non-interactive screen overlay**. Custom UIs that are set in Screen Overlay mode function as a Head Up Display (HUD) on the screen in front of the player. In this manner, you can deploy a HUD for players in your world.

This station features two example overlays:

*   **Build Info**: This simple overlay allows a designer to specify build information to be displayed on-screen. **Tip**: This custom UI is simple to implement.
    

*   **Timer**: This overlay displays the player’s name and a timer in the lower-left corner.
    
    *   The timer starts counting down when the player enters the world.
    
    *   If the player finds and runs over the button before the timer runs out, the player wins. Sounds and visual effects are played back.
    
    *   If the timer is allowed to run out, the player loses. Sounds and visual effects are played back.

Both overlays are visible in the following image:

## Configuration Differences for Screen Overlay Custom UIs

To build a non-interactive screen overlay, you must add a custom UI gizmo and configure its `initializeUI()` method. As opposed to default custom UIs that are physical objects in the world, the following changes must be applied for non-interactive screen overlays:

*   When you add a Custom UI gizmo to your world, set the Display Mode property to Screen Overlay, which causes the gizmo to be displayed as an overlay for the player.

*   In the TypeScript definition for the top-level `View()` object in the `initializeUI()` method, the position property must be set to absolute. See examples.
    
    *   Screen position of the UI is determined based on the values set for the style properties left, right, top, and bottom. These values determine the absolute distance from these screen margins in pixels.

*   `panelHeight`
    
     and `panelWidth` properties do not apply to screen overlay custom UIs. These properties can be removed or commented out from your script.

## Safe Screen Locations

When you are adding a screen overlay, you should consider where to locate it based on the supported platforms. For example, on mobile devices, action buttons may be present in some parts of the screen, which collides with the placement of a screen overlay at that location. **Tip**: The lower-left corner is generally a safe location. These example overlays are added there.

For more information, see [Safe Placement of UI Controls](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/create-for-web-and-mobile/designing-worlds-for-mobile-and-web/safe-placement-of-ui-controls/) .

## Assets

### Build Info overlay

*   Custom UI gizmo

*   Script to define the custom UI should be attached to the gizmo

### Timer overlay

The timer overlay is composed of the following sets of assets.

#### Screen overlay

*   Custom UI gizmo

*   Script to define the custom UI should be attached to the gizmo. See below.

*   Sounds to use in the timer. In this case, sounds are added from **Build menu > Sounds**:
    
    *   Button Tap - tick
    
    *   Sports Buzzer - end of timer

#### Stop button

*   Trigger Zone gizmo

*   Button object - For example, you can add a Cylinder shape and then flatten it to turn it into a visible cue on the surface beneath the trigger zone.

*   Script to send the StopTimer event

*   Sounds to use. In this case, sounds are added from **Build menu > Sounds**:
    
    *   Arcade Win - tick

## Scripts

### Station10-BuildInfo.ts

This script defines a very simple overlay that you can enable and populate with values through script properties. This script must be attached to the custom UI gizmo whose Display Mode property is set to Screen Overlay.

#### Notes

*   There are three key variables which are captured from the Properties panel and then applied in the custom UI. See Variables below.

*   Key style properties on the `View()` object:
    
    *   `Position`: `"absolute"` is required for a screen overlay.
    
    *   `display`: `this.strDisplay` is a binding to handle whether the custom UI is displayed or not based on the enabled flag in the Properties panel. See Variables below.
    
    *   The left and bottom properties are used to position the absolute location of the overlay relative to these edges of the screen. In this example, it is placed `4px` from the left margin and `4px` from the bottom margin.

#### Variables

This script maps three script properties to bindings on the custom UI. **Tip**: These script properties could be replaced by JSON data, allowing for the updating of build information from outside of the editing interface.

| Properties | Temp Variables | Bindings | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| enabled | n/a | strDisplay | When enabled is true, strDisplay is set to flex, which causes the custom UI to be displayed. When enabled is false, strDisplay is set to none, which hides the custom UI. |
| buildMessage | bM | strBuildMessage | The script property value is passed through a temporary variable (bM) and then set() to the strBuildMessage binding. |
| buildNumber | bN | strBuildNumber | Similar to strBuildMessage, this variable can be used for assigning a specific build number. |

That’s about it!

#### Properties

The Properties in this script defined the number of seconds to set for the countdown. This value must be greater than `0` to enable the timer.

The other Properties allow you to select a sound entity in your world to play for each second tick, game win, and game loss.

#### Bindings

The three Bindings are applied to the custom UI:

*   **`strPlayerName`**: This Binding is assigned to the name of the player who enters the world.

*   **`intTimeRemainingSecs`**: This Binding is initially assigned to the property value for the number of seconds to count down. With each second, it is updated to a new value that is one less than the previous value.

*   **`strDisplay`**: This String value is used to toggle visibility of the custom UI. See the style properties for how it is applied.

#### `fctnTimedIntervalAction()`

 function

This function is called to launch the timer. It requires four parameters:

*   The number of milliseconds on the timer. This value is initially set to the Property value.

*   A reference to the Component abstract class

*   The `onTickAction()` is a callback to the arrow function that is executed with each tick (second).

*   The `onEndAction` is a callback to the parameter, which is a call to a local private function `fctnGameOver()`, handling the end of game actions.

The function defines a timer ( `timerID` ) to be tied to an interval of 1000ms. Every 1000ms, if the number of milliseconds is greater than zero:

*   Execute the `onTickAction`, which plays a sound.

*   Decrement `timerMS` by 1000ms.

Otherwise, the `onEndAction()` callback is executed.

#### start() method

After the `initializeUI()` method has set up the custom UI, the following actions are executed in `start()`:

*   Set up a listener for the onPlayerEnterWorld CodeBlockEvent. When triggered, the Binding for the number of seconds on the timer is set to the value in the Properties panel.

*   Set up a listener to receive the TimerEnd event, which is set win or lose. When triggered:
    
    *   `this.async.clearInterval(this.countdownTimerID)`
        
         clears the interval set up by the `fctnTimerIntervalAction()` function, which stops the timer.
    
    *   If the timer expired:
        
        *   If the `fctnGameWin()` function has not been called yet, then call it. It is not called a second time.
        
        *   Else:
        
        *   set `booGameOver` to `true`, which initiates ending the game.

*   Timer:
    
    *   If the number of seconds in the Properties panel is greater than `0`, then call the `fctnTimerIntervalAction()` function to start the timer.
    
    *   The `onTickAction()` inline function plays the tick sound if it’s been defined.
    
    *   The `onEndAction()` action calls the `fctnGameOver()` function.

#### `fctnGameWin()`

 and `fctnGameOver()` functions

These two functions are executed when the win state or loss state is reached:

| State | How it occurs | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| win | Player enters the Trigger Zone over the button, which emits the TimerEnd event. | fctnGameWin(). After timer is stopped, a sound is played and a native UI message is displayed. |
| loss | Timer reaches 0. | fctnGameOver(). After timer reaches 0, a sound is played and a native UI message is displayed. The custom UI is hidden. |

#### Native UI

In the two functions are calls to the native UI. Example:

```
this.world.ui.showPopupForEveryone("Game Over!", 3, this.myPopupOptions);
```

The above displays the Game Over! message for three seconds applying the styling defined in `myPopupOptions`:

```
// configuration, although only some of them are modified for this example.
myPopupOptions: hz.PopupOptions => {
  position: new hz.Vec3(0, -0.5, 0), // default
  fontSize: 18, // default
  fontColor: new hz.Color (0,0,0),
  backgroundColor: new hz.Color (0.26,0.53,0.96), // lightblue = RGB(66,135,245)
  playSound: false,
  showTimer: false,
};
```

The above are all of the available styling options for these kinds of popups.

#### Test

This script can be run without the other one. When this script is run independently:

*   The timer starts and count downs.

*   When it reaches `0`, the game ends.

### Station10-StopTimer.ts

This script provides a means of stopping the timer. This script must be attached to the Trigger Zone gizmo object.

#### Notes

*   The `start()` method creates a listener for the onPlayerEnterTrigger CodeBlock event.

*   When this CodeBlockEvent fires, the method emits a TimerEnd event, which is subscribed to in the `Station10-NonInteractiveOverlay.ts` script to stop the timer.
