# Station 5 - Light the Sphere Dialog

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/custom-ui-examples-tutorial/station-5-light-the-sphere-dialog)

This station demonstrates how to use a custom UI to alter some aspect of the external world. In this case, when you click a button on the custom UI, you set the color for a sphere (The Orb of UINess) in front of you.

## Assets

*   **Station05-CustomUI: CustomUI gizmo**
    
    *   Visible: true
    
    *   Script: the script that defines the custom UI elements must be attached. See below.
    
    *   ball:
        
        *   This option is defined as part of the properties of the script. In the code, this Entity is referenced through this.props.ball references.
        
        *   When this option is enabled through the script, a designer is permitted to select an Entity that is part of the world from the drop-down.

*   **Station05-OrbOfUINess: script**
    
    *   This script defines the customUI object.
    
    *   It also creates the property definition for attaching the Sphere object to the customUI.

*   **Sphere**
    
    *   A basic shape of Sphere type

## Script

### Station05-OrbOfUINess

This customUI is similar to the one deployed in Station04. Differences:

*   A third “Off” button

*   Code to affect the color of the ball entity, based on the `onClick()` event for each button.

#### Property definition

In the code for the ClickerDialog class, you can see the following definition:

```
static propsDefinition = {
  ball: { type: PropTypes.Entity },
};
```

The above defines the ball property definition on the Properties panel of the object to which the script is attached. In this case, this ball definition is on the CustomUI object for this station.

The Entity type of the definition means that the designer is presented with a drop-down labeled ball. From this drop-down, the designer can select an entity that is already in the world.

From this drop-down, the designer can select an object that already is present in the world to be referenced through the ball property in the code. In the example world, it has already been pre-selected for you to be the Sphere entity.

As an experiment, you can try:

*   Add a different Shape to the world.

*   Select this Shape from the ball entry in the Properties panel of the Custom UI.

*   See if the code works.

#### MyButton() code

For the `MyButton()` function, you have the following code:

```
type MyButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  onClick: Callback;
  style: ViewStyle;
  baseColor: string;
};

function MyButton(props: MyButtonProps): UINode {
  const DEFAULT_COLOR = props.baseColor;
  const HOVERED_COLOR = "blue";
  const backgroundColor = new Binding<string>(DEFAULT_COLOR);
  const buttonText = new Binding<string>(props.label);

  return Pressable({
    children: Text({
      text: buttonText,
      style: {color: "white"},
    }),
    onClick: props.onClick,
    onEnter: (player: Player) => {
      console.log("onEnter";
      backgroundColor.set(HOVERED_COLOR, [player]);
      buttonText.set("hovered", [player]);
    },
    onExit: (player: Player) => {
      console.log("onExit");
      backgroundColor.set(DEFAULT_COLOR, [player]);
      buttonText.set(props.label, [player]);
    },
    style: {
      backgroundColor: backgroundColor,
      borderRadius: 8,
      height: 36,
      width: 120,
      alignItems: "center",
      justifyContent: "center",
      // additional styles are spreaded the last
      // to override default styles
      ...props.style,
    },
  });
}
```

The type definition for `MyButtonProps` contains four fields:

```
label: string;
onClick: Callback;
style: ViewStyle;
baseColor: string;
```

These are the four variables that can be applied to a UI object of MyButton type.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| label | Text label that appears on the button. |
| onClick | The onClick() event is defined as a callback to a function defined in the call to the MyButton function. |
| style | This is a customUI object type called ViewStyle, which enables styling of a UI View definition with JavaScript-like styling attributes. |
| baseColor | Text string identifying the base color for the button |

### Color constants

Above the class declaration, you can see the following constants, which define the colors to apply:

```
const colorOff: Color = new Color(0, 0, 1.0)
const colorRed: Color = new Color(0.8, 0, 0)
const colorGreen: Color = new Color (0, 0.8, 0)
```

### Define sphere as a mesh entity

To apply color properties to an entity in the world, you must create a reference to the entity as a MeshEntity type. This allows you to access via TypeScript the entity’s `style` properties, which include the color properties.

Within the `initializeUI()` method, you can see the internal variable that is defined to hold the Sphere entity from the `hz.props.ball` property value as a MeshEntity object. If this entity is valid, then the styling properties are applied to set the default color for the sphere:

```
const myBall = this.props.ball?.as(MeshEntity)!
if (myBall) {
  myBall.style.tintStrength.set(1)
  myBall.style.brightness.set(100)
  myBall.style.tintColor.set(colorOff)
}
```

You can also see the references to the nested `View()` objects. The second, nested `View()` object is defined as follows:

```
View({
  children: [
    MyButton({
      label: "Off",
      baseColor: "black",
      onClick: () => {
        console.log("Pressed Off button.");
        myBall.color.set(new Color(colorOff)); // resets ball color to default.
      },
      style: {
        //backgroundColor: "#CF1313",
        marginRight: 24,
      },
    }),
    MyButton({
      label: "Red",
      baseColor: "red",


      onClick: () => {
        console.log("Pressed Red button.");
        myBall.color.set(new Color(colorRed));
      },
      style: {
        //backgroundColor: "#CF1313",
        marginRight: 24,
      },
    }),
    MyButton({
      label: "Green",
      baseColor: "green",
      onClick: () => {
        console.log("Pressed Green button.");
        myBall.color.set(new Color(colorGreen));
      },
      style: {
        // backgroundColor: "#19AD0E",
      },
    }),
  ],
  style: { flexDirection: "row", marginTop: 12 },
  }),
```

You can see three different calls to `MyButton()`, which returns a Pressable object inserted into the `View()`. As part of each call, you can see the parameters that are passed into the function.

In particular, you can see in the `onClick()` event for each button the arrow function that is called back from the `MyFunction()` function. This callback functionality is enabled through the type definition for `MyButtonProps`.

*   Since the reference to the ball entity is defined as part of the customUI object to which the script is attached, you can reference the ball entity using the this keyword.

So, to enable a customUI object to modify properties of another object in the world:

*   Add a property to the Properties panel of the custom UI. This is done through the type definition of the Props for the class that you are extending in the TypeScript.

*   Modify the `MyButton()` function:
    
    *   Add the `onClick()` property as a callback to `MyButtonProps`.
    
    *   Add code to reference `props.onClick` in the `MyButtonProps` definition.
    
    *   Since the above is of `Callback` type, you can define the callback function as an arrow function in the parameters of the call you make to `MyButton()` function from within the `View()` in your `initializeUI()` method.
