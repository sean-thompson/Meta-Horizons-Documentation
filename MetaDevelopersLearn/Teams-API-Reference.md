# Teams API Reference

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/api-references-and-examples/Teams-api)

## Basic functions for teams based gameplay.

In Horizon, every world comes with team management logic. Players can, at any time during their session, join, leave, or change teams at will. However, a player can only be in one team of a given team group.

Team groups are ways to separate teams into different sets. This allows the creation of multiple gameplay bubbles with their own teams in a single world.
