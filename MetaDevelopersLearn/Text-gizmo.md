# Text gizmo

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/use-the-text-gizmo)

In Meta Horizon Worlds, the text gizmo is part of a suite of helper tools called [gizmos](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/code-blocks-and-gizmos/about-gizmos) , which are designed to enhance the creation and interactivity of worlds. The text gizmo allows users to show static text or display dynamic text when combined with [scripts](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/build-your-first-game/module-1-build-your-first-game) based on different triggers in the environment.

The text gizmo supports [markup](https://github.com/MHCPCreators/horizonCreatorManual/blob/main/HorizonTechnicalDoc.md#text-gizmo-markup) commands that allow you to change color, size, font, bold, italics, underline, vertical and horizontal offsets, line height, alignment, and more. The initial text can be set in the [Properties panel](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/user-interface/UI-panels-and-tabs#properties-pane) using these markups, and dynamic changes can be done through [scripting](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_textgizmo) . **Note**: While you can access and use gizmos in the Meta Horizon Worlds [VR tool](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/create-a-new-world-in-horizon) , this topic focuses on the creator experience in the [desktop editor](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor) .

## Limitations

The total length of the text, including all markup, [is limited](https://github.com/MHCPCreators/horizonCreatorManual/blob/main/HorizonTechnicalDoc.md#text-gizmo-limitations) . Additionally, when using text gizmo for internationalization and localization, consult [Getting started with internationalization](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/internationalization/getting-started-with-internationalization) , 

[Writing for localization](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/internationalization/writing-for-localization)

, and [Typescript for internationalization](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/internationalization/typescript-for-internationalization) .

## Optimization

In order for worlds to be published, certain areas of your world need to [stay below 100% capacity](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/capacity-limits-in-horizon) . Text gizmo is one such area of simulation and animation that needs your attention. Learn more about optimization in [Memory limits and performance metrics](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/memory-limits-horizon-worlds) .

## Access the text gizmo

In the Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor, do the following to access the text gizmo:

*   In the desktop editor while in Build mode, select **Build** \> **Gizmos** from the menu bar, search for “Text” in the search field.
    

*   Select the text gizmo and drag it into the scene.
    

*   You can now edit the new gizmo properties in the **Properties** panel.
    

## Text gizmo properties

The text gizmo properties can be configured in the **Properties** panel of the desktop editor or through scripting.

## Scripting

To create a dynamic text display, use Meta Horizon Worlds [text gizmo API](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_textgizmo) . Text gizmos are Meta Horizon Worlds entities, see more examples in [Entity](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_entity#examples) ## What’s next?
