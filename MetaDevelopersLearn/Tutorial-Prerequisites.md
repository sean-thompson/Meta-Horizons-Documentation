[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorial-worlds/getting-started-with-tutorials/tutorial-prerequisites)

Before you begin exploring these tutorials, please verify that you have met the following requirements.

## Meta Horizon Worlds Account

You need a Meta Horizon Worlds account. See [https://horizon.meta.com/](https://horizon.meta.com/) .

## Meta Quest Link App on Your Desktop

You must install the Meta Quest Link application on your desktop. See [Install Oculus app for Meta Quest Link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/) .

## Desktop Editor

The desktop editor is the interface for building your worlds and the TypeScript scripts to support them. This desktop application is available for download and is auto-updated with each release of the platform. For installation instructions, see [Install and run the desktop editor](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor) .

## TypeScript Basics

TypeScript is the scripting language used in building Meta Horizon Worlds. TypeScript extends core JavaScript with strict data typing, which provides better support for complex programming structures.

For a brief overview of TypeScript, see [Using TypeScript in Meta Horizon Worlds](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/using-typescript-in-horizon-worlds/) .

For a tutorial, see [TypeScript Tutorial](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/typescript-tutorial/) .

## Optional

#### IDE

An integrated development environment (IDE) can be connected to the desktop editor for building your TypeScript scripts. **Visual Studio Code is recommended.** For more information, see [Adding an IDE to Desktop Editor](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/adding-an-ide-to-desktop-editor) .
