# Units of measurement

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/getting-started/unts-of-measurement)

Scale, distance, movement, and other physical properties in Meta Horizon Worlds are measured in [SI Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) . Note that some of the following units may only be measured or applied using the relevant [TypeScript API](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/) :

| Quantity | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| Distance | Meters |
| Rotation | Values shown in the desktop editor are given in degrees. Rotations using the TypeScript API use Quaternions. The Quaternion class includes functions to convert to or from Euler angles. |
| Scale | Percentage of the original model size, where 1.0 is 100% |
| Mass | Kilograms |
| Acceleration | Meters/second2 |
| Velocity | Vec3 with magnitude in meters/second |
| Angular Velocity | Vec3 where the direction is the axis of rotation and the magnitude is in radians/second |
| Angular Acceleration | Vec3 where the direction is the axis of rotation and the magnitude is in radians/second2 |
| Force | Vec3 with magnitude in Newtons |
| Impulse | Vec3 with magnitude in Newtons * seconds |
| Torque | Vec3 where the direction is the axis of rotation and the magnitude is in Newton meters |
