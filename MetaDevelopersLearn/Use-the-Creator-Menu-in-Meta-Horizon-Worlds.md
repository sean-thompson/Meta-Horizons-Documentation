# Use the Creator Menu in Meta Horizon Worlds

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/using-the-creator-menu)

When in Build Mode, press the menu button on your left controller to open your Creator Menu. Here’s where you’ll find everything from shapes and gizmos to color palettes and publishing settings. The four main categories in the menu (from left to right) are: Build, Style, Publish, and Settings.

## Building with Shapes

Tap the **Build** icon in the dock. This is where you can create objects like shapes (primitives), gizmos and sounds. In order to create a new object, make sure you’re using the Grab tool.

To create an object:

*   From your Creator Menu, select **Shapes**, then highlight a shape with either cursor.

*   Grab the shapes and drag it into your world.

Shapes can be scaled by:

*   Grabbing the shape using both controllers.

*   Moving your hands closer or farther apart.

There are also three handles you can use on a shape to stretch, move and rotate the shape along a single axis.

To stretch a shape:

*   Highlight the shape using either cursor.

*   Grab a Stretch handle to stretch a single side.

*   Highlighting the Stretch handle reveals the Move handle and Rotate handle, which can be grabbed and used the same way.

## Styling Your Shapes

Tap the Brush icon to go to Style. Here’s where you can use the Paint tool to:

*   Paint shapes.

*   Add a material to shapes.

*   Adjust material intensity.

To paint a shape:

*   Tap a color using either controller.

*   Highlight the shape with your primary controller.

*   Click the index trigger to apply the color.

A material can also be applied to shapes the same way. These materials only affect the appearance of the object and include **Plastic**, 

**Metal**

 and **Glow**.

For **Plastic** and **Metal**, adjusting the Material intensity changes how much light gets reflected off of the object.

For **Glow**, adjusting the Material intensity changes how much light the object emits.

## Publishing Your World

Select the **Publish** icon in the dock to go to Publish. From here, you can:

*   Add details to your world.

*   Check your world’s capacity levels.

*   Adjust material intensity.

## Settings

Tap the Settings icon to go to Settings. From here, you can:

*   Change your primary hand.

*   Adjust the size and angle objects will snap to when snapping is turned on.

*   Play, stop and reset your world.

To turn snapping on or off, use the thumbstick on your secondary controller to select Snap.
