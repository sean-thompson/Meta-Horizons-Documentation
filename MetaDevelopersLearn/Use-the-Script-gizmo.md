# Use the Script gizmo

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/scripting/use-the-script-gizmo)

## To add a script to a world:

*   From Build Mode, select **Gizmos**.

*   Select and hold the script gizmo.

## To write a script:

*   Select the script and select the **Three Dot** menu to open the Script Panel.

*   At the top, name the script.

*   In the left column, tap on a field to add the name of any object you’ll be referencing.

*   In the right column, add variables.

*   Tap **New Code Block** and select options from the dropdown.

*   Tap **Compile** when you’re done to save the script.

## To attach a script to an object:

*   Open the object’s Properties Panel.

*   At the bottom of the panel, select the script from the dropdown for **Attached Script**.

## To connect an object reference:

*   Open the Properties Panel of the object you want to reference.

*   Grab the Entity Reference connector on the right side of the panel.

*   Attach the connector to the input on the bottom left side of the Properties Panel for the object with the attached script.

## Additional things to know about scripting:

*   Make sure to tap **Compile** after writing a script. Otherwise the script won’t be saved.

*   Scripts need to be attached to an object in order to run.

*   There can only be one script per object.

*   The name of the script will be displayed on the gizmo itself. If you change the name of a script, it won’t automatically update references to that script.

*   Collaborators can see the Script Panel, but they won’t be able to see changes unless the script is compiled and the panel is closed and reopened. Code Block Reference
