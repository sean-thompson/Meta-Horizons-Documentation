# Use your controllers in Build Mode of Meta Horizon Worlds

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/vr-creation/getting-started/using-controllers-in-build-mode)

Controllers replace your hands in Build Mode. Your primary controller has your main tools, while your secondary controller has supporting actions. Controllers can display up to four options at a time which can be selected by pushing the thumbstick up, down, left or right.

The teardrop-shaped cursor on each controller indicates which tool youâ€™re currently using, and is the main way to interact with objects in the world. Placing the tip of either cursor inside an object will highlight it and reveal its bounding box. The bounding box provides a visual cue as to which object is currently being highlighted, selected or manipulated.

## Moving in Build Mode

### Moving Around

To move around, use a reach and pull motion:

*   Reach either hand forward.

*   Hold down the grip button of your Touch controller.

*   Pull your hand back and release the grip.

Alternate your hands to go faster.

### Turning Around

To turn around:

*   Hold down the grip on both hands.

*   Move your hands as if turning a wheel.

### Scaling Your Avatar

To make your avatar larger:

*   Hold down both of the grip buttons on your Touch controllers.

*   Move your hands closer together.

To make your avatar smaller:

*   Hold down both of the grip buttons on your Touch controllers.

*   Move your hands farther apart.

## Understanding the controllers

### Changing Your Primary Hand

*   While in Build Mode, select the **Menu** icon on your left controller to open the Creator Menu.

*   Select the **Settings** icon and go to Settings.

*   Select **Build Settings** and then select **Dominant Hand**.

*   Select **Right** or **Left**.

### Primary Controller Options

*   **Grab Tool**: Used to select and move objects. Once an object is highlighted, hold down the index trigger to grab and move it around. You can also hold down the index trigger in empty space and swipe through an object to select it.

*   **Duplicate Tool**: Creates a copy of an object. Highlight an object and hold down the index trigger to grab a copy of it. You can also grab a Move handle to duplicate the object along an axis.

*   **Lock and Unlock Tool**: Prevents an object from being edited, moved or deleted. Once an object is highlighted, click the index trigger to lock it, and again to unlock it.

*   **Paint Tool**: Used to add color and a material to shapes. Highlight the shape and click the index trigger to apply the color or material. See the Style section for more about using this tool. **Note**: Switch back to the Grab tool after using any other tool to avoid accidental duplicates, locking or painting.
