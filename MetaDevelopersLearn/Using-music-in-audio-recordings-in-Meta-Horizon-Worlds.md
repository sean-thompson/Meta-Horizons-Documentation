We want to encourage musical expression in Meta Horizon Worlds while making sure we uphold our agreements with music rights holders. These agreements protect artists, songwriters and other music rights holders by setting limitations around how music is used on Meta platforms.

Please keep the following general guidelines in mind when using music in your audio recordings:

*   Content may be scanned for copyrighted music; if copyrighted music is detected in your recording, your content may be blocked.

*   To prevent your content from being blocked, consider using content from the Facebook Sound Collection, [our exclusive collection of music and sound effects](https://www.facebook.com/sound/) . To use the Facebook Sound Collection, you will need to [add your Facebook account](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/accounts/account-settings-and-management/add-or-remove-account-from-accounts-center/) to the same Accounts Center as your Meta account.

*   Singing or playing your own original music is generally not restricted.

In most cases, you will receive a notification when our systems detect that your recorded audio may include music in a way that doesnâ€™t follow our licensing agreements. Please note that our system conducts periodic retroactive scans, so your content may be muted at a later point in time, even if your recorded audio was initially available.

## How to appeal

If you believe you have the right to use the content you may appeal any blocked or muted content by contacting IP@oculus.com.
