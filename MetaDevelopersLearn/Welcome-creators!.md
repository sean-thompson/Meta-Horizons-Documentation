# Welcome creators!

Welcome to Worlds

As a developer in Worlds, you are the creator, whether you code or you don’t. Worlds is an integrated game creation system that enables you to create a new world for users to play in and enjoy. What you create is up to you--you can choose to create a simple fishing game, a 3D walk-through of an ancient city, a rollicking first-person shooter, or a complex fantasy RPG. Literally, the sky’s the limit. Worlds gives you an easy-to-use desktop editor to use to create a new world and then add objects, scripts, sounds, and more.

As the creator of a world, you can:

*   Create a world for your game.

*   Add collaborators so you can build the world together with someone else.

*   Add shapes, gizmos, sounds, and colliders to your world

*   Insert stock assets or create custom ones to populate your world

*   Create and edit scripts using TypeScript to add behaviors to objects in your world, or generate code snippets using AI

*   Publish, or alternatively, delete your world.

When someone visits Worlds as a user, they always see the published version of a world. As a world creator, you can access both the published version and the editable version of your world.

## Getting started

The initial step toward creating your first world is to [install the desktop editor](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/install-desktop-editor) . This desktop editor is your main platform for creating a world, and it contains many other tools that you’ll find useful as you create. To see what tools are available to you as a creator, check out our [tools overview](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/tools-overview) . After you’ve installed the desktop editor, we suggest you try the [create your first world tutorial](/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/get-started/create-your-first-world) . This is the first of a two-part tutorial where you’ll learn how to create a simple game in Worlds. You can follow this up with the second part of the tutorial, which continues to walk you through building a simple game. In these two introductory tutorials, you’ll experience most of the basic aspects of working with a world, such as:

*   Creating your world

*   Setting up the tooling you need

*   Selecting and manipulating assets for your world

*   Importing custom models

*   Adding entities and scripting behavior for them

*   Previewing your world for playtesting

*   Trying your world out both on mobile and in virtual reality

*   Publishing your world on mobile

## Meta Horizon Creators Program

Once you have learned how to create worlds, join the [Meta Horizon Creator Program (MHCP)](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/programs) ! As a member, you gain:

*   Access to monetization opportunities including monthly bonuses, in-world purchases and competition cash prizes.

*   Helpful resources including educational content, technical support and a collaborative creator community.

## Community

The Meta Quest [Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/GAuMXKEY3t) is a great way to meet people, see new worlds, and connect with other world creators on the `#hw-world-creators` channel.

Members of the [Meta Horizon Creator Program](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/programs) are invited to join the [Meta Horizon creator forum](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Meta-Horizon-Creator-Forums/ct-p/Meta_Horizon_Creator_Forums) , where they can connect and collaborate with other MHCP creators. Non-members may still visit the forum and observe the conversation, but you’ll need to enroll in MHCP to see all the content or fully participate in the conversation.
