Creators who are responsible for governing a members-only world should take steps to ensure members abide by the rules set for that world and Meta’s [Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/) . For example, if you observe someone being harassed or mistreated, it is important to take action. This may involve using the tools you have at your disposal, such as muting or removing the member from your world. Setting preventative measures, such as clear rules and assigning moderators to help monitor the world, can also help to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. By taking these steps, you can create a safer and more welcoming environment for all users.

Please note that while the primary goal of this test is to learn how Meta can empower creator-led governance, unaddressed persistent or egregious issues in a creator’s members-only world may result in their removal from the Alpha program.
