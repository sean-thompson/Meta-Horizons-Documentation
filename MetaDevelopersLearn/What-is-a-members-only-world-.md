# What is a members-only world? **Note**: The ability to create members-only worlds is currently only available to a select group of creators as part of an alpha test.

Members-only worlds are a new type of closed space, similar to personal space, that is membership-based. Creators are responsible for governance in this space and can select members they would like to access their world and set additional world-specific rules. Members-only worlds are a place where communities of like-minded people can come together and enjoy a shared experience. During the alpha test, members-only worlds can have up to 150 members and 25 members can visit the world at the same time; when a world reaches max capacity of 25 members, no additional members can join until someone leaves.
