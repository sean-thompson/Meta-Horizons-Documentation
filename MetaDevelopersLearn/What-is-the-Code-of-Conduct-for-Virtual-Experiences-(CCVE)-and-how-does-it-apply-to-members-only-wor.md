# What is the Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences (CCVE) and how does it apply to members-only worlds? [The Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences (CCVE)](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/code-of-conduct-for-virtual-experiences/) places emphasis on our values of voice, safety, authenticity, dignity and privacy. It also draws a distinction between closed experiences and public experiences. Creators are primarily responsible for addressing conduct and content issues in closed experiences, such as members-only worlds and Personal Space. They determine the culture of their world and they best understand the context of the world environment. This means that the day-to-day moderation of members-only worlds is up to the world creator and any member with a moderator role (as assigned by the world creator). Meta will work to ensure that creators effectively moderate their space, and can take action in situations where this is not happening.

Part of the purpose of the members-only worlds alpha test is for Meta to determine the information, tools and processes that need to be further developed in order for creators to manage moderation successfully.
