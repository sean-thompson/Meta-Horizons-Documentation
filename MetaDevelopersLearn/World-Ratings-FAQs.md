| Why do I need to take a world rating survey? | As part of our goal to offer Meta Horizon Worlds to 10-12 year olds via parent-managed accounts, we have built  additional features, including a 3-tier world rating system with the following categories: ages 10+, ages 13+ and ages 18+. The survey is part of the publishing process and makes it simple for you to get the right rating for your world. |
| How can I access the world rating survey? | You can access the survey by going to Build mode, choosing your world, and then going to World rating > Get rating. |
| By when do I need to take the world rating survey? | The survey is optional for existing worlds. If you don’t take it, any world currently rated Mature/ 18+ will be rated ages 18+ and world currently rated Everyone, will be rated ages 13+ rating. You only need to take the survey to be considered for an ages 10+ rating. If you’d like to do so, we’re recommending creators to take the world rating survey before September 17, 2024. |
| Approximately how long will it take me to complete the world rating survey? | The survey is quick and should take you no longer than a few minutes to complete. |
| What happens if I am not happy with the rating my world has been assigned? | Creators can re-take the survey at any time, after making changes to their world so that a new rating can be assigned. After completing the survey, your world’s rating will be reviewed to ensure it is accurate based on the content within your world. It is possible that Meta may change your world’s rating after this review process. Creators will be notified of any changes via email. The email will contain details on how to appeal a rating if you believe that a rating has been wrongly assigned.  We have made changes that will help us respond to appeals more quickly than we have in the past. |
| What happens if I don’t take the world rating survey? | If you have published your world as of May 21, 2024, then you have already taken the survey. Existing worlds currently rated 18+ will be rated ages 18+. All other worlds will be rated ages 13+.  We recommend you always retake the survey if you make major modifications to your world. |
| What impact will this have on monetization? | Assuming your world currently has the correct rating, the new 3-tier rating system should have no negative impact on your earnings as a creator. Worlds rated ages 10+ have the biggest potential reach. |
| What other ways does the survey help end users? | Your responses to the survey will help populate up to 40 content descriptors that are visible on your world details page. The content descriptors will help people know what they can expect if they visit your world and help ensure the best audience for your worlds. |
| What do I do if the content in my world changes? | We encourage you to retake the world rating survey if you’ve made significant changes to the content of your world. |
| What are the content descriptors that will appear on my world details page? | Content descriptors are short descriptions about the kinds of things inside your world. Examples include realistic or fantasy violence, realistic blood or violence, references to tobacco, alcohol, or gambling,  and more. |
| After I submit the survey, how long does it take for the world rating to go into effect? | The world rating output based on your survey responses go into effect immediately after survey submission. |
| How do I know how much alcohol is too much alcohol in a world to still be 13+? | Alcohol is not allowed in 10/13+ worlds and must be marked as 18+. |
| Where is the line drawn between violence and intense violence? | We recommend using caution when determining the level of violence your world. Our content guidelines require intense violence, which may include depictions of gore, dismemberment or decapitation to be marked as 18+. |
| How does the acceptable level of horror between ratings break down? | Audience preferences vary so it’s important to assess whether a world’s content could create an environment that would trigger anxiety, especially for younger users. If world content reaches the level in which it could scare users it should be marked as 18+. |
| How will a 10+ or 13+ rating impact discovery? | These ratings primarily impact users with Parent-managed accounts. Preteen users will only be able to discover worlds and rating categories which have been approved by their parent/guardian who manages the account. At this time there is no general discoverability impact to users who are 13+ |
| What will be the source of information for content descriptors for worlds that receive the default 13+ rating on September 17? | Any world without a completed survey will not contain content descriptors on the world detail page. |
| Who are the third party advisors that you’ve worked with? | Please see our TTC labs report that details out all of the work we have done with third parties. |
