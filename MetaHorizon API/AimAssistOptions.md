## Remarks

assistanceStrength - The intensity of the pulling force towards the Aim Assist target, in degrees of camera rotation per second. The default value is 10.

  

targetSize - The size of the target used to determine whether the assistance forces apply, in meters. A bigger target causes the assistance to apply when the aiming reticle (center of the screen) is farther away from the center of the target. The default value is 4.

  

noInputGracePeriod - The duration in seconds after which the aim assistance stops being applied when no input is received. 0 = infinite. The default value is 1.
