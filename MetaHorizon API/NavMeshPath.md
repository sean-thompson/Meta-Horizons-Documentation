# NavMeshPath type

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/navmesh_navmeshpath)

Defines the pathfinding calculation results retrieved by the [NavMesh.getPath](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/navmesh_navmesh#getpath) property.

## Signature

```
export declare type NavMeshPath = {
    waypoints: Vec3[];
    startPos: Vec3;
    endPos: Vec3;
    destinationPos: Vec3;
    pathReachesDestination: boolean;
};
```

## Remarks

Variables:

  

waypoints: The list of waypoints for the generated path.

  

startPos: The origin point for the generated path.

  

endPos: The terminal point for the generated path. This might not be the same as the query destination.

  

destinationPos: The requested terminal point for the generated path. This may not be reachable, and can differ from endPos.

  

pathReachesDestination: true if the endPos reaches the destinationPos, false if an incomplete path is returned.
