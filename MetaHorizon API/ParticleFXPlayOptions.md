## References [Player](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_player) ## Remarks `fromStart` \- true to play the effect from the beginning even if already playing. Otherwise, the effect doesn't play if already playing. `players` \- The array of players to apply the change to. `oneShot` \- If true, the effect emits a new particle that plays until its full duration completes. This does not interfere with other play interactions.
