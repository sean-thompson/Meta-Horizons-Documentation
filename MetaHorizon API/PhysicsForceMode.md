## Enumeration Members

| Member | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Force | 0 | Add a continuous force to an object, using its mass. The acceleration = Force * Time ^ 2 / Mass. |
| Impulse | 1 | Add an instant force impulse to an object, using its mass. The acceleration = Force * Time / Mass. |
| VelocityChange | 2 | Add an instant velocity change to an object, ignoring its mass. The acceleration = Force * Time. |
