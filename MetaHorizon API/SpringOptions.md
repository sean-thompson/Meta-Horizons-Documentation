# SpringOptions type

[source](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_springoptions)

The spring physics settings for an entity. Spring physics moves an entity as if it were attached to a spring.

## Signature

```
export declare type SpringOptions = {
    stiffness: number;
    damping: number;
    axisIndependent: boolean;
};
```

## Remarks

For more information, see [PhysicalEntity.springPushTowardPosition()](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_physicalentity#springpushtowardposition) and [PhysicalEntity.springSpinTowardRotation()](/horizon-worlds/reference/2.0.0/core_physicalentity#springspintowardrotation) .

  

stiffness: The stiffness of the spring, which controls the amount of force applied to the object.

  

damping: The damping ratio of the string, which reduces oscillation.

  

axisIndependent: true if the object's motion is parallel to the push direction; false otherwise.
